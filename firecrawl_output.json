Are the authors trying to prove ketamine better than usual care of etomidate, or that etomidate is more harmful? Perhaps non-inferiority design would have been better.\n*   Due to non-normal distribution of the primary outcome, the authors used an advanced _generalised linear model_ analysis. This makes the meaningfulness of the result hard to interpret, which at a p-value = 0.056 it is only just _statistically non-significant_.\n    *   Conventional Student\u2019s t-test (which may not be applicable) gives p-value = 0.0467 in favour of ketamine.\n*   Sub-group data in figure 3 missing negative sign and graphical plot does not match numerical data.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study investigates an interesting clinical dilemma and does not demonstrate any important clinical difference in organ failure scores between ketamine and etomidate when used as a single bolus for induction\n*   It is my impression that the likelihood of a type II error (false negative) is high in this study and there is a trend suggesting benefit from ketamine in patients with sepsis compared against etomidate\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\]\u00a0[Etomidate versus ketamine for rapid sequence intubation in acutely ill patients: a multicentre randomised controlled trial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60949-1/abstract)\n    \n*   \\[editorial\\]\u00a0[Best pharmacological practice in prehospital intubation](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61071-0/fulltext)\n    \u00a0by Wenzel and Lindner\n*   \\[correspondence\\]\u00a0[Etomidate versus ketamine for sedation in acutely ill patients](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61784-0/fulltext)\n    \u00a0by Mongardon and Singer\n*   \\[calculator\\]\u00a0[SOFA Scores](http://www.mdcalc.com/sequential-organ-failure-assessment-sofa-score/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Rapid Sequence Intubation of the Shocked Patient](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/rapid-sequence-induction-of-the-shock-patient/)\n     by LITFL\n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 22 October 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@DavidSlessor](http://twitter.com/DavidSlessor)\n\n[RSI](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/rsi/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/waterfall-6473754-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/uncategorized/prepare-ii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4210553-FAKT-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/fakt/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/high-flow-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/sjoblom/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/ketased/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

However, as those treated with nasal oxygen had such significant gains and the treatment has minimal side effects,\u00a0this will become my standard practice for critically ill patients. If during RSI you have an episode of hypoxia and you have not applied nasal O2 the question should be asked as to why not.\n\n### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[Apneic oxygenation during prolonged laryngoscopy in obese patients: a randomized, controlled trial of nasal oxygen administration](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952818010000048)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[St. Emelyns Best Bet apneic oxygenation during endotracheal intubation](http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=2541)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[EMCrit: Preoxygenation, Reoxygenation and Deoxygenation](http://emcrit.org/preoxygenation/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Difficult Airway Society Proposed Guideline 2015 including the use of apneic oxygenation](http://www.das.uk.com/content/update_on_new_das_guidelines_2015)\n    \n\n### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 23rd October 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Intubation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/intubation/)\n[RSI](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/rsi/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/medicines-1006823_1920-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nico-noninvasive-airway-management-of-comatose-patients-with-acute-poisoning/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/DEVICE-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/device/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/apneic-oxygenation-during-prolonged-laryngoscopy-in-obese-patients-a-randomized-controlled-trial-of-nasal-oxygen-administration/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The Lancet 1961, Volume 278, Issue 7199, Pages 404-406\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   Does the application of cricoid pressure during induction of anaesthesia control the regurgitation and \u00a0pulmonary aspiration of gastric or oesophageal contents?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Case series of 26 patients\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Single centre (Middlesex Hospital, London)\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Patients at \u2018high risk\u2019 of regurgitation of oesophageal or stomach contents\n    *   18 laparotomy for intestinal obstruction\n    *   3 gastrectomy for pyloric stenosis\n    *   2 oesophagoscopy for achalasia of the cardia\n    *   2 forceps delivery\n    *   1 resection for oesophageal cancer\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Application of cricoid pressures\n    *   exerted by an assistant (nurse or midwife accompanying patient \u2018can be shown in a few seconds how to do it\u2019\n    *   before induction, cricoid is palpated and lightly held between the thumb and second finger. Pressure is exerted on the cricoid cartilage mainly by the index finger as anaesthesia begins\n    *   as soon as consciousness is lost, firm pressure is applied without obstruction of the patient\u2019s airway\n    *   cricoid pressure is maintained until intubation and inflation of the cuff of the endotracheal tube is completed\n*   In all cases:\n    *   Ryle\u2019s or oesophageal tubes were fully aspirated and then removed before induction of anaesthesia. The rationale was that this would otherwise interfere with the effectiveness of cricoid pressure\n    *   patients were positioned in a slight head-down tilt\n*   Other interventions:\n    *   pre-oxygenation was advised\n    *   an intravenous barbituate and muscle relaxant was used. However, if the patient was \u2018seriously ill\u2019 inhalational induction was considered\n*   A short acting muscle relaxant was noted to provide faster intubating conditions\n\n### Control\n\n*   No control group\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: regurgitation of oesophageal or gastric content visualised into the pharynx\n    *   23 patients \u2013 cricoid pressure maintained until endotracheal cuff inflated\n        *   0 witnessed regurgitation\n    *   3 patients \u2013 cricoid pressure released after induction of anaesthesia and before intubation\n        *   3 out of 3 had regurgitation\n*   Secondary outcome: whilst the author concludes that cricoid pressure prevents gastric distension from bag-valve-mask ventilation, this is not mentioned in the results and the methodology just reports that it is feasible to do this\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Cricoid pressure can a) control regurgitation of stomach or oesophageal contents during induction of anaesthesia and b) prevent gastric distension from postive-pressure ventilation applied by facepiece or mouth-to-mouth respiration. It is contraindicated during active vomiting\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   This is an important case series from over 60 years ago\n*   The choice of technique for intubation was based on practice at the time and therefore easily applicable\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   There are many\u2026\n*   Not randomised\n*   Only 3 patients had cricoid pressure released and no statistical tools should be applied\n*   Removing an orogastric tube in a patient who is considered \u2018high risk\u2019 is questionable now\n*   Positioning head down again is not modern practice and would have increased the risk of regurgitation. Whether it reduces risk of aspiration can be debated but this case series was looking for regurgitation\n*   Force used with cricoid pressure not mentioned or validated\n*   There is no mention of choice of anaesthetic agents and whilst a quick acting muscle relaxant may have been used, it not clear if this did happen\n*   No mention of grades of anaesthetists involved. Variability in practice including the use of positive pressure ventilation prior to intubation will affect gastric distension regardless of whether cricoid pressure is applied\n*   Difficulties such as recognised oesophageal intubation are not mentioned. This would increase your risk of regurgitation\n*   This is Grade 4 evidence and strength of recommendation would be low by current standards\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   There is no empirical evidence supporting the use of cricoid pressure (CP) beyond this single case series and expert opinion (grade 4-5 evidence)\n*   Those advocating its use, emphasise the associated high mortality rate if aspiration occurs. Opposition point to the poor evidence for improved safety and potential harm with CP. This includes making it harder to intubate and ventilate if the anatomy of the glottis becomes distorted as well as decreasing oesophageal tone (which may actually increase the risk of regurgitation)\n*   The Difficult Airway Society (DAS) are revising their guidelines for 2015 and I hope will begin to de-emphasise the overstated evidence base for CP use in RSI.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\] [Cricoid Pressure to Control Regurgitation of Stomach Contents During Induction of Anaesthesia](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(61)92485-0/fulltext)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine \u2013 Levels of Evidence (March 2009)](http://www.cebm.net/oxford-centre-evidence-based-medicine-levels-evidence-march-2009/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Cricoid Pressure.

A RCT is warranted, comparing the use of DSI with the use of other techniques for achieving pre-oxygenation, when traditional methods have failed.

On the basis of these results, TXA should be considered for use in bleeding trauma patients.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled\n*   Pragmatic study\n*   Large numbers\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Randomisation based on subjective opinion of treating physician; no standardised criteria for the definite use of TXA \u2192 selection bias\n*   No stratification of injury severity\n*   Follow up period only 28 days and was incomplete\n*   Non-standardisation on the use of fluids/blood products in groups. TXA did not reduce transfusion rates\n*   Only 5% of patients in both groups actually died of haemorrhage\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The absolute risk reduction in mortality with the use of TXA in trauma patients is very small. Neither did it reduce the amount of blood products administered. However, TXA is unlikely to cause harm and hence will continue to be part of practice in the management of the bleeding trauma patient\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(10)60835-5.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Morrison JJ, Dubose JJ, Rasmussen TE, Midwinter MJ.

How frequently did this happen? This possibly limits generalisability.\n*   \u2018Statistical significance\u2019 only demonstrated after extensive multivariate post-hoc analysis \u2014 this should not be considered a certain conclusion\n*   Funding limitations meant that not all patients were followed-up for 90-day and 1-year outcomes \u2014 study terminated after last recruited patient followed-up to 28-day outcome\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study was under-powered to demonstrate clinically relevant effects\n*   However, it suggests strongly with a low risk of bias that pentoxifylline 400mg daily for 28 days has no beneficial effect whilst prednisolone 40mg daily for 28 days may be beneficial for short-term outcomes but not for medium or long-term outcomes\n*   From these data (with wide confidence intervals that cross the null hypothesis line)\n    *   Prednisolone NNT (28-day mortality) is 23\n    *   Prednisolone NNH (serious adverse infection) is 16\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[STOPAH: Prednisolone or Pentoxifylline for Alcoholic Hepatitis](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1412278)\n    \n*   \\[study protocol\\]\u00a0[STOPAH study protocol](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=7600287684310043726#)\n    \n*   \\[videocast\\] [STOPAH](http://www.nejm.org/action/showMediaPlayer?doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1412278&aid=NEJMoa1412278_attach_1)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: @[DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 5 May 2015  \nPeer-review editor: [@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\n[Hepatology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/hepatology/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/delirium-city-oracle-eyes-4090949-1-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/arie-trial-rifaximin-for-encephalopathy/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/avb-tips-feature-image-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/avb-tips/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/stopah/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

However, these controls may become exposed cases in subsequent minutes. In the propensity matched groups, a number of patients that were intubated within 15 minutes were included in the no intubation group. These patients could have also been included in the intubation group.\n*   Baseline difference \u2013 significantly more patients with VF/VT and witnessed arrest in no intubation group; and significantly lower use of adrenaline\n*   Due to the difficulty of collecting accurate data during a cardiac arrest there is the \u00a0possibility of timings being misclassified\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients that have an in-hospital cardiac arrest the use of intubation was associated with an increased mortality. These results were\u00a0significant in both the unadjusted results and the propensity score-matched analysis. Due to weaknesses in the study design and concerns over possible missed confounding variables, further studies are required. This study has helped to demonstrate equipoise that should allow a RCT to be performed. In the mean time, this paper will certainly make me think twice before I reach for the laryngoscope. It also\u00a0highlights to me the importance of minimal interruptions to effective chest compressions and as always to make decisions on management of patients in a case-by-case fashion.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2598717)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Association Between Arterial Hyperoxia Following Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and In-Hospital Mortality](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/185969)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[St Emlyns journal club: intubate or not intubate](http://stemlynsblog.org/jc-intubate-or-not-intubate-that-is-the-question/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0David Harvie  \nSummary date: 12/04/2017  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@davidslessor](http://www.twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\n[Cardiac Arrest](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiac-arrest/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 6 comments\n\n*   Pingback: [In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: The First 15 Minutes - R.E.B.E.L.

PSM makes some important and fundamental assumptions:  \n    1\\. Each patient could really have received either of the treatments being compared. The idea is that we compare patients who had equal probabilities of receiving a treatment, some of whom \u201cby chance\u201d were allocated to treatment and others not (we are supposed to have accounted for all other major determinants of treatment allocation in calculating the propensity score, therefore chance is the major determinant of treatment allocation that remains.) This is a fundamental assumption and if it\u2019s not true PSM is an inappropriate analysis.  \n    2\\. We are comparing patients with equal treatment propensity (probability of treatment allocation). Note that this is a very very difficult thing to establish in practice. This is because to know any individual\u2019s probability of treatment allocation you have to have a very robust causal model of treatment allocation (a good model of all the factors which might increase or decrease the probability of treatment allocation). But treatment allocation is an extremely complex phenomenon and mapping out it\u2019s causal determinants is a hard problem. Doing this would involve a series of observational studies and experiments in it\u2019s own right (which are usually not done). For some inexplicable reason, many researchers simply see which of a finite list of incidentally measured variables is associated with treatment propensity and use these instead of mapping out the causal determinants.\n    \n    Back to the paper at hand by Anderson et al. Consider assumption 1: Could all patients really have received the treatments being compared? The answer is that we do not know. We are comparing ventilation with or without intubation. But was it possible to ventilate all the patients without intubation? If not clinicians were forced to intubate (the decision did not occur by chance) \u2013 this violates assumption 1 and the analysis fails.\n    \n    Now consider assumption 2. What kind of factors determine the probability that intubation will occur in a given minute of cardiac arrest? The authors do not explicitly outline their causal model of treatment allocation as regards intubation vs not in a given minute of cardiac arrest. This is a major flaw that undermines the analysis. In fact, treatment propensity was based on factors that happened to be measured in an observational dataset not designed for this purpose, rather than factors likely to be causal determinants. As a clinician I would suggest some critical factors determining treatment propensity here might be ease of ventilation without intubation (likely a major determinant), operator experience, presence or absence of airway soiling, and the etiology of the arrest. Are these factors used in calculating the propensity score? Essentially no.\n    \n    In summary this analysis is fundamentally flawed because 1) It\u2019s not clear that all patients could have been allocated to both treatments being compared (a fundamental assumption of PSM) and 2) The propensity scores for individual patients are probably not reflective of actual treatment propensity because they are not calculated using all (or even most) of the factors which causally determine whether clinicians will intubate during cardiac arrest, but rather were estimated based on other factors which probably are not causal determinants of treatment allocation.\n    \n    e.g. Suppose a patient vomits, aspirates and suffers a hypoxic cardiac arrest. The resuscitating team note gross airway contamination and suction and intubation occurs early during the resuscitation. ROSC occurs but ultimately the patient dies. Did early intubation play a causal role in this man\u2019s death? Would he have done better if intubation had been delayed? All sensible clinicians know the answer to this question and it should illustrate why drawing conclusions from this flawed analysis will only lead clinicians astray.\n    \n    Conclusion: It is possible that patients may be harmed by the inappropriate deferral of intubation based on a very flawed analysis of this large dataset and overinterpretation of this flawed analysis. Practice personalised medicine. If you need to tube during a cardiac arrest, tube. If you don\u2019t or can\u2019t or it\u2019s not going to help, don\u2019t.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/anderson-2/?replytocom=565#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6ebe4ebbf2c4d64a0a3a8884e9e326d?s=56&d=mm&r=g) [Simon Orlob (@SimonOrlob)](http://twitter.com/SimonOrlob)\n    \n    [31 May 2017 at 7:49 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/anderson-2/#comment-572)\n    \n    Just a few thoughts and please prove me wrong!\n    \n    Incidents: 46% on a regular floor, 25% even not on telemetry, 22% non witnessed (16% non-intubation vs. 25% intubation).  \n    Maybe we should discuss early warning scores before we abolish intubation based on this study?!?\n    \n    \u2018Baseline difference \u2013 significantly more patients with VF/VT and witnessed arrest in no intubation group; and significantly lower use of adrenaline\u2019  \n    Might lead to the hypothesis: The non-intubation group included those patients in need of just a short sequence of CPR vs. the intubation group with prolonged CPR.  \n    Nobody can tell or did I overlooked time to ROSC/duration of CPR?\n    \n    Even a little more provocative: The cohort in this study would have benefitted from intubation.  \n    Sure, not pre-ROSC but maybe 1 hour before coding.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/anderson-2/?replytocom=572#respond)\n    \n    *   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b70363d0a3e7e0af814bdc7acda3ae8e?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Duncan Chambler\n        \n        [13 July 2017 at 7:33 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/anderson-2/#comment-602)\n        \n        Simon,  \n        Thanks for your comment and sorry I\u2019m only just replying now. I agree with your points. In some bigger hospital institutions, an in hospital cardiac arrest is probably no better than a community cardiac arrest, as the patient may not be monitored and the arrest may not be detected until the next set of observations are due! Scary thought.  \n        I think this is a provocative study but it just raises more questions than it answers.

This is associated with a 5-fold decrease in survival.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Large sample size, multi-centre\n*   Pre-determined rules for determining appropriateness of antimicrobials\n*   Some known biases are adjusted for by the multivariate analyses, suggesting that the observed effect is likely to be real, even if exact magnitude cannot be determined from this study\n*   Simple statistical approach\n*   Large effect size (OR 6.95-9.45) so clinically relevant\n*   Similar results found in all subgroups thereby giving us confidence in results\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Retrospective analysis, therefore confounded by multiple biases\n*   Irrespective of unknown biases, the cases and controls definitely differed significantly according to parameters which are very likely to have affected the outcome: specifically patients who didn\u2019t receive appropriate antibiotics were more likely to have been immunosuppressed, \u00a0have had surgical complications, line infections, disseminated infections and hard to treat / highly pathogenic organisms (P aeruginosa, S aureus, \u00a0yeasts/fungi)\n*   The study give no data on patients lost to follow up; this could be an additional source of bias\n*   In the case of culture negative infections the gold standard (2 or 3 expert opinions / concordance with guidelines) is weak, although similar to that seen in clinical practice\n*   Duration of follow up is not stated\n*   Indication for source control in >40% but it was not stated if this was performed\n*   Data is historical: some as early as 1996. Overall mortality is very high based on current standards\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In adult patients with septic shock inappropriate initial choice of empiric antibiotic therapy is associated with ~5-fold absolute reduction in survival, even after correction for co-morbidities, clinical presentation and organism. The effect size is greatest in patients with primary blood stream infections, urinary tract infections, and infections due to anaerobes or yeasts.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[pubmed\\]\u00a0[Initiation of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy results in a fivefold reduction of survival in human septic shock](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19696123)\n    \n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Initiation of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy results in a fivefold reduction of survival in human septic shock](http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/22156/zcb01109001237.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[TBL Summary of \u2018Duration of hypotension before initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy\u2019](http://www.wessexics.com/page55/index.php?id=4691254840479560405)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Effect of Immediate Administration of Antibiotics in Patients With Sepsis in Tertiary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28062114)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@drthinx](https://twitter.com/drthinx)\n\u00a0for University Hospital Southampton General Intensive Care Journal Club  \nSummary date: 28th April 2015  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\u00a0/ [@Duncan Chambler](http://twitter.com/duncanchambler)\n\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ACORN-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/acorn/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/STRESS-L-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/stress-l/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/kumar-2/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

When used as a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Large, multicentre, international RCT\n*   Ampoules and packaging were identical in appearance and prepared by an independent pharmaceutical company\n*   Correct masking and coding of ampoules was checked by independent random testing of each batch by high-performance liquid chromatography to confirm the contents of the ampoules\n*   Only 33 patients (0.16%) were lost to follow-up\n*   Trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00872469)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Two important design changes occurred with the study after it was commenced\n    *   **Sample size increased** by 5000 patients during the study. The rationale for this was based on an anticipated baseline event rate of 2.5% for death and 2.5% for hysterectomy and that 1% of women die after hysterectomy. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although TXA could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. The sample size was therefore increased from 15,000 to 20,000 with the intention that this might compensate for the dilution of the treatment effect from hysterectomies that were done at the same time as randomisation and that the study had enough power to detect a reduction in death from PPH\n    *   **Study hypothesis was refined**\u00a0after commencing the study in light of outcome findings from the CRASH-2 study (published in 2011). The authors explain that mortality with death due to bleeding was changed to the main secondary outcome. This was done before un-blinding and without knowledge of the trial results\n*   There was no formal screening for embolic complications and perhaps these were missed, particularly as follow-up was limited to hospital discharge or on 42 days if still in hospital\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Tranexamic acid _may_ be beneficial in reducing the risk of death due to post-partum haemorrhage. The study has some significant methodological limitations, including a change in power calculation and hypothesis after it was commenced, as well as a low fragility index. On the basis of it being cheap with a good safety profile in this study, consider giving tranexamic early in post-partum haemorrhage. Early resuscitation, management of coagulopathy and surgical assistance with source control, are the most important interventions\n\n### Infographic\n\n[![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-04-at-20.46.54.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-04-at-20.46.54.png)\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[Paper\\] [WOMAN trial \u2013 Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30638-4/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr)\n    \n*   \\[Editorial\\]\u00a0[WOMAN: reducing maternal deaths with tranexamic acid](http://womantrial.lshtm.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Editorial.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[videocast\\] [WOMAN \u2013 TXA History](https://youtu.be/VbDDxzyp1rQ)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [BroomeDocs \u2013 Thoughts on the WOMAN Trial](http://broomedocs.com/2017/05/thoughts-woman-trial/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [CRASH-2](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/crash-2/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n  \nSummary date: 2nd May 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Celia Bradford](https://twitter.com/celiabradford)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec262d2240fa4dd96691d0188dbb86d9?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Melvin Leong\n    \n    [5 May 2017 at 11:09 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/woman-trial/#comment-563)\n    \n    One significant confounder to applying these findings to my practice in the UK is that only 569 patients were in the UK.

These make interpretation of the study\u2019s findings more difficult.\n*   The mechanism of the observed survival benefit is difficult to explain.\n*   Rates of re-intubation (14% vs. 13%) and tracheostomy (13% vs. 20%) were high.\n*   Generalisability:\n    *   No surgical patients were included due to their need for continuous analgesia.\n    *   Does the control group represent common practice? Modern practice targets lighter sedation than was common at the time.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The use of SATs during this trial appears to expedite weaning from mechanical ventilation, but the study findings may potentially reflect greater levels of oversedation in the control group or a bias towards early extubation in the intervention group. Their use may be associated with greater risk of self-extubation and increased nursing workload\n\n### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[Efficacy and safety of a paired sedation and ventilator weaning protocol for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care (Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial): a randomised controlled trial by Girard et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60105-1)\n    \n*   \\[editorial\\]\u00a0[Sedation in the intensive-care unit: good and bad? by Brochure](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60082-3)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Sedation in ICU by Life in the Fast Lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/sedation-in-icu/)\n    \n\n### Metadata\n\nSummary author: Barnaby Dykes for the University Hospital Southampton GICU Journal Club (edited by [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n)  \nSummary date: 5th December 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Sedation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sedation/)\n[Ventilation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/ventilation/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TAME-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/blog/ebm/tame/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vent-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/the-rest-trial/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   Pingback: [Reconnect \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/reconnect/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/abc/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Intensive Care Medicine 2017. published on-line. DOI 10.1007/s00134-017-4911-0\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill adult patients who pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), does 1-hour rest compared with immediate extubation reduce re-intubation rates at 48 hours?\n\n### Background\n\n*   SBTs are used to assess if patients are likely to be successfully liberated from a mechanical ventilator. Post-extubation respiratory failure and the need for re-intubation occurs in 5-30% of patients. These patients have an increased risk of mortality. Respiratory muscles can become fatigued and it is hypothesised that a SBT can lead to fatigue and increase the probability of failure. This trial tried to determine if giving patients a period of rest following a SBT would lead to a higher success rate when liberating patients from a mechanical ventilator.\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n    *   Central randomisation with computerised random-number tables in blocks of 4\n    *   Stratified by centre and risk of extubation failure before SBT\n*   Allocation concealment maintained through numbered opaque envelopes\n*   Non-blinded\n*   Investigators who collected endpoints excluded from clinical decisions\n*   Registered with [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01915563)\n    \n*   Statistical analysis\n    *   Sample size calculation:\n        *   1372 patients required to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction in the intervention group from a 15% baseline, with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\n    *   Intention to treat analysis\n    *   Categorical variables compared with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 or Fisher\u2019s exact test\n    *   Normally distributed continous variables compared with Student\u2019s t test\n    *   Non-normally distributed continous variables compared with Mann-Whitney U test\n    *   Multi-variate model assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve and the goodness of fit by Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n### Setting\n\n*   17 medical-surgical ICUs, Spain\n*   Data collected: October 2013 \u2013 January 2015\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Received invasive mechanical ventilation for \u226512 hours\n    *   Successfully completed a SBT (screened daily)\n*   Exclusion:\n    *   Age <18 years, tracheostomy, overwhelming respiratory secretions, inability to follow commands, do-not-resuscitate or re-intubate orders, formal indication for non-invasive ventilation after extubation\n*   470 patients randomised\n*   Comparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention groups\n    *   Age: 62 vs. 65, p=0.96\n    *   APACHE II: 18.3 vs. 17.8, p=0.41\n    *   Co-morbidities >1: 37% vs. 47%, p=0.03\n    *   Upper airway problems: 22% vs. 29%, p=0.08\n    *   COPD: 14% vs. 17%, p=0.58\n    *   \\> 1 failed SBT: 11% vs. 12%, p=0.75\n    *   Copious secretions: 15% vs. 9%, p=0.06\n    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation before SBT: 5.5 vs. 5.7 days, p=0.85\n    *   SBT technique\n        *   T-tube: 87% vs. 94%\n        *   Duration of SBT of 120min: 31.7% vs. 20.7%, p=0.009\n    *   High risk for requiring re-intubation: 83% vs. 84%\n        *   Defined as high risk if met any of the following criteria:\n            *   Age >65\n            *   Congestive heart failure as reason for intubated\n            *   COPD\n            *   APACHE II >12 on extubation day\n            *   BMI >30\n            *   Ineffective cough or copious respiratory secretions (>2 suctioning in the 8 hours before extubation)\n            *   \\>1 failed SBT\n            *   \\>1 co-morbidity\n            *   Problems related with upper airway (including intubation >7 days)\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Reconnected to ventilator for 1-hour\n    *   Post-successful completion of SBT\n    *   At previous ventilatory parameters\n    *   Then directly extubated\n    *   9 (3.7%) patients did not tolerate reconnection to the ventilator, and therefore directly extubated\n\n### Control\n\n*   Immediate extubation\n    *   Post successful competion of SBT\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Patients screened daily for SBT\n*   Criteria for assessing weanability by SBT:\n    *   Subjective: resolution of the acute phase of disease for which patient was intubated, adequate cough, absence of tracheobronchial secretions\n    *   Objective: HR <140, sBP 90-160 with no or minimal vasopressors, temp <38C, adequate level of consciousness, SpO2 >90% at FiO2 \u22640.4 and PEEP <8, RR<35, minute volume <10L/min and f/VT <105 breaths/min/L\n*   Technique for SBT (T-tube, low-level pressure support, continuous positive pressure airway pressure (CPAP) and duration (30, 60 or 120 min) at discretion of treating physician\n*   Successful SBT defined as:\n    *   Correct gas exchange (SpO2 \u226585-90%, PaO2 \u226550-60mmHg, FiO2 \u22640.4 pH \u22657.32, increase in PaCO2 <10mmHg),\n    *   Haemodynamic stability (HR <140, systolic BP <180-200mmHg and >90mmHg without vasopressors)\n    *   Stable ventilatory pattern (RR <30-35 and <150% from basal)\n*   The protocol at each participating hospital determined the treatment of post-extubation respiratory failure.

This study may therefore have been underpowered to detect any difference\n*   This is a small study with only 119 patients\n*   The choice of statistical analysis is unclear. Van Elteren analsysis is typically used where stratification according to a confounding covariate is needed to allow greater statistical power at demonstrating an association between two variables. This has been used to stratify according to medical centres. Why would the results vary between medical centres unless the expertise of medical personnel and protocols are widely varied?\n*   The authors do not specify exactly which high FiO2\u00a0facial mask was used. The assumption is that this is a hudson mask with a reservoir bag rather than a tight fitting mask with Ambu reservoir or a Water\u2019s circuit\n*   Nearly a 1/5th of patients were requiring non-invasive ventilation in the hour preceding randomisation. Removing NIV and changing to facemask would have resulted in derecruitment. Whilst high flow nasal may provide some additional PEEP, this would be insignificant compared with NIV.\n*   The secondary outcomes are mostly dependent on operator variability. There should be no reason why the presence of HFNC should impact on ability to perform successful intubation. If this study was looking at effectiveness of an adequate face-mask seal during apnoeic oxygenation, this would be far more informative\n*   Large difference between the urgency of the intubation. 12 patients (20%) of the HFNC required intubation without delay compared with 16 (51%) in the HFFC group\n*   No specific mention of airway being kept patent after induction and before intubation. This would effect the success of apnoeic oxygenation with HFNC\n*   Arterial oxygen measurement would have been more reliable than SpO2. The authors state that arterial access seemed \u2018unthinkable due to the severity of the hypoxaemia and level of endotracheal intubation emergency\u2019. However in 2/3rd of cases, it was concluded that intubation could wait up to one or more hours.\n*   No doses of muscle relaxant recorded.\u00a0This may have influenced the difficulty and time to successful intubation\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In this study, using high-flow nasal cannula, without discontinuation during an apnoeic period, was not any more effective\u00a0than using a high FiO2\u00a0facemask at 15 l/min for preventing desaturation during RSI. Given the methodological and statistical concerns, this cannot be concluded with certainty, and if the question is still of interest then a larger RCT is needed.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\] [High-flow nasal cannula oxygen during endotracheal intubation in hypoxemic patients: a randomized controlled clinical trial](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869405)\n    \u00a0\n*   \\[further reading\\] [PulmCrit:\u00a0Apneic oxygenation and high-flow nasal cannula don\u2019t prevent desaturation during intubation?](http://www.pulmcrit.org/2015/04/apneic-oxygenation-and-high-flow-nasal.html?m=1)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Weingart S and Levitan R: Preoxygenation and Prevention of Desaturation During Emergency Airway Management](http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644%2811%2901667-2/pdf)\n    \n*   \\[podcast\\] [Weingart S.\u00a0EMCrit Podcast 40 \u2013 Delayed Sequence Intubation (DSI)](http://emcrit.org/podcasts/dsi/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Chrimes N.

Compared with standard treatment esmolol also increased stroke volume, reduced noradrenaline requirements + was associated with an improved 28 day mortality.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n*   Powered for primary outcome\n*   Standardised resuscitation strategies\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Single centre, non-blinded, no placebo (potential for overestimate of effect size, and for unconscious bias in care delivery)\n*   Primary outcome is not clinically relevant\n*   Not powered for secondary outcomes e.g. mortality\n*   Usual care was significantly different to standard UK practice (PA catheters, ubiquitous use of steroids, fluid resuscitation for 96 hours guided by filling pressures, high use of levosimendan 49.4% in esmolol group). Therefore, significant concerns about generalisability of results.\n*   The patients in this study appear to have been very unwell at baseline (median dose of noradrenaline approaching 0.4ug/kg/min at enrolment), with a high prevalence of multi-resistant organisms cultured. Despite this, 28 day mortality of 80% in the control group is concerning, and raises substantial questions of whether a similar results would be seen in patients with a lower severity of illness. As Pinksy states\u00a0[\u201c80% mortality in the control group can hide a lot of sin.\u201d](http://ccforum.com/content/18/3/304)\n    \n*   A non-standard method of calculating SAPS II scores was used (at study enrolment after resuscitation, rather than taking the worst values in the first 24 hours of ICU admission) for reasons that aren\u2019t well explained in the paper. This makes it difficult to compare this cohort with those in other intensive care units.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The use of esmolol for tachycardic patients in septic shock resulted in good control of heart rate, and a reduction in noradrenaline dose, without any significant side effects. \u00a0A large mortality benefit was reported with the use of esmolol; but with a number of \u00a0study limitations, further evidence is required before a change in practice is justified.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[\\[Effect of Heart Rate Control With Esmolol on Hemodynamic and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Septic Shock A Randomized Clinical Trial\\]](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1752246)\n    \n*   \\[Further Reading\\]\u00a0[Pinksy Critical Care Journal Club](http://ccforum.com/content/18/3/304)\n    \n*   \\[Podcast\\]\u00a0[Myburgh Intensive Care Network](http://intensivecarenetwork.com/myburgh-john-beta-blockers-and-sepsis/)\n    \n*   \\[Further Reading\\]\u00a0[EM Docs Beta Blockers in Sepsis](http://www.emdocs.net/beta-blockers-in-sepsis/)\n    \n*   \\[Further Reading\\]\u00a0RCT: Esmolol improves clinical outcome and tissue oxygen metabolism in patients with septic shock through controlling heart rate\n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[The influence of esmolol on septic shock and sepsis: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269160)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@MikeW\\_J](https://twitter.com/MikeW_J)\n\u00a0(from Portsmouth journal Club)  \nSummary date: 10 November 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Shock](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/shock/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Designer-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/danger-shock-microaxial-flow-pump-in-infarct-related-cardiogenic-shock/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ACORN-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/acorn/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/esmolol-sepsis/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

When used as a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, tranexamic acid should be given as soon as possible after bleeding onset\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Large, multicentre, international RCT\n*   Ampoules and packaging were identical in appearance and prepared by an independent pharmaceutical company\n*   Correct masking and coding of ampoules was checked by independent random testing of each batch by high-performance liquid chromatography to confirm the contents of the ampoules\n*   Only 33 patients (0.16%) were lost to follow-up\n*   Trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00872469)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Two important design changes occurred with the study after it was commenced\n    *   **Sample size increased** by 5000 patients during the study. The rationale for this was based on an anticipated baseline event rate of 2.5% for death and 2.5% for hysterectomy and that 1% of women die after hysterectomy. However, during the trial it became apparent that the decision to conduct a hysterectomy was often made at the same time as randomisation. Although TXA could influence the risk of death in these cases, it could not affect the risk of hysterectomy. The sample size was therefore increased from 15,000 to 20,000 with the intention that this might compensate for the dilution of the treatment effect from hysterectomies that were done at the same time as randomisation and that the study had enough power to detect a reduction in death from PPH\n    *   **Study hypothesis was refined**\u00a0after commencing the study in light of outcome findings from the CRASH-2 study (published in 2011). The authors explain that mortality with death due to bleeding was changed to the main secondary outcome. This was done before un-blinding and without knowledge of the trial results\n*   There was no formal screening for embolic complications and perhaps these were missed, particularly as follow-up was limited to hospital discharge or on 42 days if still in hospital\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Tranexamic acid _may_ be beneficial in reducing the risk of death due to post-partum haemorrhage. The study has some significant methodological limitations, including a change in power calculation and hypothesis after it was commenced, as well as a low fragility index. On the basis of it being cheap with a good safety profile in this study, consider giving tranexamic early in post-partum haemorrhage. Early resuscitation, management of coagulopathy and surgical assistance with source control, are the most important interventions\n\n### Infographic\n\n[![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-04-at-20.46.54.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-05-04-at-20.46.54.png)\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[Paper\\] [WOMAN trial \u2013 Lancet](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30638-4/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr)\n    \n*   \\[Editorial\\]\u00a0[WOMAN: reducing maternal deaths with tranexamic acid](http://womantrial.lshtm.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Editorial.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[videocast\\] [WOMAN \u2013 TXA History](https://youtu.be/VbDDxzyp1rQ)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [BroomeDocs \u2013 Thoughts on the WOMAN Trial](http://broomedocs.com/2017/05/thoughts-woman-trial/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [CRASH-2](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/crash-2/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n  \nSummary date: 2nd May 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Celia Bradford](https://twitter.com/celiabradford)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ec262d2240fa4dd96691d0188dbb86d9?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Melvin Leong\n    \n    [5 May 2017 at 11:09 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/woman-trial/#comment-563)\n    \n    One significant confounder to applying these findings to my practice in the UK is that only 569 patients were in the UK.

JAMA 2010; 303(4): 341-348. doi:10.1001/jama.2010.2\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with septic shock who are treated with corticosteroids, does tight glycaemic control (4.44\u20136.1 mmol/l) compared with less-tight glycaemic control (<8.3 mmol/l) reduce in-hospital mortality?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Septic shock is a characterised by a dysregulated host response to an infection including hypotension that is not corrected by fluid administration alone\n*   The administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone in particular) is thought to attenuate this response and evidence suggests that it reduces the degree of hypotension although it may not ultimately prevent death\n*   A consequence of corticosteroid administration is dysregulation of glucose control, which may be harmful\n*   It is possible that intensive insulin therapy, with the aim of tight serum glucose control within normal physiological parameters, may counteract some of the harm from corticosteroids allowing them to be more beneficial in patients with septic shock\n*   This trial also investigated the effect of additional fludrocortisone as a secondary outcome as the interaction between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids had not been adequately studied in patients with septic shock\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial\n*   Multicentre\n*   2\u00d72 factorial design generating 4 groups of patients\n    *   Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\n    *   Arm 2: fludrocortisone vs no-fludrocortisone\n*   Open-label\n    *   Patients, clinical staff and research staff were aware of allocation\n    *   No attempt to blind participants or staff\n    *   No placebo therapy was used\n*   Centralised web-based randomisation process with permutation blocks of variable size to conceal allocation prior to recruitment and randomisation\n*   Hydrocortisone and other non-study therapies were standardised and controlled in keeping with 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidance\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   Power calculation based only on Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\n    *   Estimated 50% in-hospital mortality in control group\n    *   Expected absolute reduction of 12.5% (25% relative reduction in mortality)\n        *   This can be compared to the 32% relative reduction found in\u00a0[Van den Berghe\u2019s intensive insulin trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)\n            )\n    *   Statistics based upon \u03b1 = 0.05 and Power (1-\u03b2) = 80%\n\n### Setting\n\n*

**Arm 1**: Intensive Insulin Therapy\n    *   Adapted from the [Van den Berghe trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)\n        \n    *   Insulin was initiated when blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl)\n    *   Commenced at 2 units/hr\n    *   Blood glucose levels were checked at least hourly for first 3 hours and less frequently thereafter if stable\n    *   Target range was 4.44\u20136.1 mmol/l (80\u2013110 mg/dl)\n    *   Hypoglycaemia (< 4.44 mmol/l \\[80 mg/dl\\] ) was treated with 10g glucose\n    *   Insulin infusions were stopped on discharge from Intensive Care unless the patient presented with insulin dependence\n*   **Arm 2**: Addition of fludrocortisone\n    *   Hydrocortisone was continued\n    *   9-\u03b1-fludrocortisone 50 \u00b5g\u00a0was administered via nasogastric tube each morning at 8 am for 7 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Arm 1**: Conventional glucose control\n    *   Physicians were advised to follow the [2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090974)\n         and not to follow the Intensive Insulin Therapy trial protocol\n        *   \u201cmaintenance of blood glucose <150 mg/dL \\[8.3 mmol/l\\] after initial stabilization\u201d\n    *   Treatment dose and route of insulin was at the treating physician\u2019s discretion\n*   **Arm 2**: No addition of fludrocortisone\n    *   Hydrocortisone was continued\n    *   Fludrocortisone was not administered\n    *   No placebo was administered either\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Physicians were advised to follow the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for all non-trial therapies\n*   Hydrocortisone was administered as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours to all patients for 7 days from recruitment\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Good separation between groups was achieved, with statistically significant lower blood glucose observed in the intervention group compared to the control group\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: There was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality between the Intensive Insulin Therapy and the Conventional Glucose Control\n    *   Intensive Insulin Therapy: in-hospital mortality 45.9%\n    *   Conventional Glucose Control: in hospital mortality 42.9%\n    *   Absolute Risk Increase: 2.97% (95% CI -5.66% to 11.60%; P = 0.53)\n    *   Relative Risk: 1.07 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.30)\n    *   Hazard Ratio (using time to death analysis and not just \u2018dead/alive\u2019): 1.04 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.34; P = 0.78)\n\n*   **Secondary outcome**:\n    *   There was no evidence of interaction with fludrocortisone (P = 0.31)\n        *   In-hospital mortality (with vs without): 42.9% vs 45.8%\n        *   Absolute Risk Reduction: 2.98% (95% CI\u00a0-5.66% to 11.61%)\n    *   No pre-defined subgroup analysis identified any benefit from intensive insulin therapy or fludrocortisone administration\n    *   Median length of stay in ICU and hospital was not different\n    *   Duration of vasopressor therapy and mechanical ventilation was not different\n    *   The incidence of hypoglycaemia was significantly higher in the Intensive Insulin Therapy group\n        *   Intensive Insulin Therapy: 16.4%\n        *   Conventional Glucose Control: 7.8%\n        *   Absolute Risk Increase: 8.6% (95% CI\u00a02.97% to 14.23%)\n        *   Number-needed-to-harm: 12\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   This trial provides no evidence to support intensive insulin therapy (blood glucose target 80 to 110 mg/dl \\[4.44 to 6.1 mmol/l\\] ) for patients with septic shock being treated with corticosteroids\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   The hypothesis is reasonable given the described theory (but note comment in Weaknesses below), and the\u00a0randomised, controlled trial design is arguably the best method to investigate this hypothesis\n*   The multi-centre design increases external generalisation\n*   The centralised, web-based randomisation process is the gold standard for concealing group allocation and preventing allocation bias\n*   The power calculation was based on previous data, although in retrospect it was over optimistic to expect the intervention to reduce mortality by 25%\n*   The statistical methods and intention-to-treat analysis plan were appropriate for the data types\n*   Attempts were made to standardise non-study care according to published guidelines, which may reduce any ascertainment bias due to the lack of blinding, although the compliance with this was not reported\n*   Good separation was demonstrated between the groups with regards to blood glucose levels, increasing the internal validity of the results\n*   The primary outcome is objective and binary, reducing observer bias and simplifying assessment and analysis\n*   The small confidence intervals around the null-effect point suggest that a true benefit or harm is unlikely, which strengthens the conclusion of this trial\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The hypothesis tested tight glucose control with a target of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l against less-tight glucose control with a target of < 8.3 mmol/l, which are arguably not that dissimilar and perhaps the theory has not been adequately tested with this trial\n    *   Compare this with [NICE-SUGAR](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nice-sugar/)\n        \u2018s relaxed glucose control with a target of 8.0 to 10.0 mmol/l\n*   The open-label design may introduce significant biases as clinical staff may unconsciously treat the patients differently depending upon their group allocation, which usually exaggerates the effect in favour of the intervention group\n*   The time-frame for the primary outcome \u2013 in-hospital events \u2013 introduces the possibility of distortion of the results due to \u2018clipping\u2019\n    *   If patients get home but still die more often then this significant outcome will be missed\n    *   30-day mortality is frequently used for a fairer assessment of outcome but this requires more trial resource to follow-up discharged patients\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial provides evidence against Intensive Insulin Therapy in patients administered hydrocortisone for septic shock, and furthermore there is no benefit from additional fludrocortisone\n*   The narrow confidence intervals suggest that any true benefit is small and this must be balanced against the significant incidence of hypoglycaemia (NNH 12)\n*   This adds to the theory regarding steroids in sepsis \u2013 if they are of benefit, counteracting the possibly harmful hyperglycaemia with tight glycaemic control does not make any difference to short-term patient outcomes compared to less-tight glycaemic control\n\n####

N Engl J Med 2009; 360:1283-97.\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill adults that are expected to be in Intensive Care for 3 days or more, does intensively controlled blood glucose compared to conventionally controlled blood glucose reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial.\n*   Stratified randomisation using minimisation algorithm for type of admission (operative vs non-operative) and geographical region.\n*   Allocation was appropriately concealed before randomisation.\n*   Treating clinicians were not blinded.\n*   Aimed to recruit 6,100 patients to provide a power of 90% to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 3.8%, assuming a baseline mortality of 30%, with an accepted two-sided alpha level of 0.05 or less.\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis method.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Medical and surgical ICUs across Australia and New Zealand (87.5%), and North America (12.5%).\n*   38 academic tertiary care hospitals and 4 community hospitals\n*   December 2004 to November 2008.\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Patients expected to require 3 or more days of care on an ICU, with an arterial line to allow blood sampling\n*   Exclusion: Admitted for DKA or hyperosmolar state; expected to be eating by day 3; high-risk of hypoglycaemia such as insulin-secreting tumour or fulminant liver failure.\n*   40,171 were screened. 6,104 patients were recruited.\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   _Intensive-control_: control of blood glucose to a level between 4.5 and 6.0 mmol/L (81 and 108 mg/dL).\n    *   Insulin in saline was administered to keep glucose less than 6.0 mmol/L (108 mg/dL)\n    *   This was titrated to blood glucose, and stopped if it fell below 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL)\n    *   The intervention was stopped when patients were eating, discharged from ICU, deceased or 90 after randomisation\n    *   97.2% required insulin during the trial\n    *   Mean time-weighted blood glucose level was 6.4 mmol/L (115 mg/dL).\n\n### Control\n\n*   _Conventional-control_: control of blood glucose to a level less than 10.0 mmol/L (180mg/dL)\n    *   Insulin in saline was administered to keep glucose less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)\n    *   This was titrated to blood glucose, and stopped if it fell below 8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL)\n    *   The intervention was stopped when patients were eating, discharged from ICU, deceased or 90 after randomisation\n    *   69.0% required insulin during the trial\n    *   Mean time-weighted blood glucose level was 8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL).\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: There was a statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality that favoured conventional-control.\n    *   Intensive-control: 27.5%\n    *   Conventional-control: 24.9%\n    *   Absolute difference: 2.6% (95% CI 0.4-4.8)\n    *   Odds ration for death with intensive control: 1.14 (95% CI 1.02-1.29; p=0.02)\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   No difference in\n        *   the mortality rate at 28 days\n        *   the median length of stay in ICU or hospital\n        *   the development of new organ failure\n        *   the number of days of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy\n        *   the rates of red-cell tranfusion or positive blood culture\n    *   a significant difference in\n        *   the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (6.8% in intensive-control; 0.5% in conventional-control)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   A blood glucose target of less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) resulted in lower mortality than a target of 4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L (81 to 108 mg/dL), and the authors do not recommend use of the lower target in critically ill adults.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Well designed, pragmatic study designed to answer a clinically relevant research question.\n*   2.4% withdrew consent and 0.3% were lost-to-follow-up: negligible attrition bias.\n*   99.5% were administered the correct management according to the study algorith: stengthens the internal validity (accuracy) of the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The treatment was discontinued prematurely in 10.0% of patients in the intervention group and 7.4% in the conventional-control group. The most common reasons were physician decision or a change to palliative care. This difference may have introduced bias to the results, especially as the clinicians were unblinded. These rates are lower than the primary outcome incidence, and are therefore unlikely to change the direction of the primary outcome, but may have exaggerated the effect size.\n*   More patients in the intensive-control group received corticosteroids (34.6% vs 31.7%; p=0.02). This may affect the measured outcome, but predicting how and to what extent is not possible.\n*   The median blood glucose level achieved in the intensive-control group was 6.4 mmol/L, which is above the target range of 4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L. This demonstrates the difficulty in achieving this target range, and it may reduce the observed difference between the two groups.\n*   The majority of patients received nutrition via enteral feeding routes, perhaps reducing generalisability to patients being fed parenterally.\n*   The authors do not attempt to explain why there was a difference in mortality at 90 days, but not at 28 days. Why should intensive-control of blood glucose have a harmful effect on _late_ survival odds?\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial demonstrates better survival if a _conventional_ blood glucose target of less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) is used in critically ill patients.  \n    The trial\u2019s strong internal validity and external generalisability suggests this should be used in clinical practice in developed countries for adult patients.\n\n#### Links\n\n[Full text pdf](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625)\n / [abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625)\n / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0810625\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Inzucchi and Siegel.

JAMA 2010; 303(4): 341-348. doi:10.1001/jama.2010.2\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with septic shock who are treated with corticosteroids, does tight glycaemic control (4.44\u20136.1 mmol/l) compared with less-tight glycaemic control (<8.3 mmol/l) reduce in-hospital mortality?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Septic shock is a characterised by a dysregulated host response to an infection including hypotension that is not corrected by fluid administration alone\n*   The administration of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone in particular) is thought to attenuate this response and evidence suggests that it reduces the degree of hypotension although it may not ultimately prevent death\n*   A consequence of corticosteroid administration is dysregulation of glucose control, which may be harmful\n*   It is possible that intensive insulin therapy, with the aim of tight serum glucose control within normal physiological parameters, may counteract some of the harm from corticosteroids allowing them to be more beneficial in patients with septic shock\n*   This trial also investigated the effect of additional fludrocortisone as a secondary outcome as the interaction between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids had not been adequately studied in patients with septic shock\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial\n*   Multicentre\n*   2\u00d72 factorial design generating 4 groups of patients\n    *   Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\n    *   Arm 2: fludrocortisone vs no-fludrocortisone\n*   Open-label\n    *   Patients, clinical staff and research staff were aware of allocation\n    *   No attempt to blind participants or staff\n    *   No placebo therapy was used\n*   Centralised web-based randomisation process with permutation blocks of variable size to conceal allocation prior to recruitment and randomisation\n*   Hydrocortisone and other non-study therapies were standardised and controlled in keeping with 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidance\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   Power calculation based only on Arm 1: intensive insulin therapy vs conventional glucose control\n    *   Estimated 50% in-hospital mortality in control group\n    *   Expected absolute reduction of 12.5% (25% relative reduction in mortality)\n        *   This can be compared to the 32% relative reduction found in\u00a0[Van den Berghe\u2019s intensive insulin trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)\n            )\n    *   Statistics based upon \u03b1 = 0.05 and Power (1-\u03b2) = 80%\n\n### Setting\n\n*   11 Intensive Care Units across France\n*   January 2006 to January 2009\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**:\n    *   Adults who met the criteria ([ACCP/SCCM 1992](http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.101.6.1644)\n        ) for severe sepsis\n    *   [SOFA score](https://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/apache-versus-sofa-scoring-systems/)\n         \u2265 8\n    *   Requirement for vasopressors / inotropes to maintain systolic BP > 90 mmHg or mean BP > 60 mmHg\n    *   Receiving hydrocortisone 50mg IV every 6 hours\n*   **Exclusion**: pregnancy; moribund patients expected to die imminently\n*   946 patients screened; 509 were included and all were included in primary outcome analysis; 25 were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge (i.e. lost for some secondary outcomes)\n*   Groups were well balanced for measured baseline variables\n\n| Variable | Arm 1: Intensive | Arm 1: Conventional | Arm 2: With Fludrocortisone | Arm 2: Without Fludrocortisone |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age | 64 years | 64 years | 64 years | 64 years |\n| SOFA score | 10.4 | 10.8 | 10.6 | 10.1 |\n| Type of admission | 88.5% medical | 85.9% medical | 89.9% medical | 84.9% medical |\n| Blood glucose at recruitment | 12.0 mmol/l | 11.3 mmol/l | 11.8 mmol/l | 11.5 mmol/l |\n| Table of baseline characteristics |     |     |     |     |\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   **Arm 1**: Intensive Insulin Therapy\n    *   Adapted from the [Van den Berghe trial](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa011300)\n        \n    *   Insulin was initiated when blood glucose > 6.1 mmol/l (110 mg/dl)\n    *   Commenced at 2 units/hr\n    *   Blood glucose levels were checked at least hourly for first 3 hours and less frequently thereafter if stable\n    *   Target range was 4.44\u20136.1 mmol/l (80\u2013110 mg/dl)\n    *   Hypoglycaemia (< 4.44 mmol/l \\[80 mg/dl\\] ) was treated with 10g glucose\n    *   Insulin infusions were stopped on discharge from Intensive Care unless the patient presented with insulin dependence\n*   **Arm 2**: Addition of fludrocortisone\n    *   Hydrocortisone was continued\n    *   9-\u03b1-fludrocortisone 50 \u00b5g\u00a0was administered via nasogastric tube each morning at 8 am for 7 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Arm 1**: Conventional glucose control\n    *   Physicians were advised to follow the [2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15090974)\n         and not to follow the Intensive Insulin Therapy trial protocol\n        *   \u201cmaintenance of blood glucose <150 mg/dL \\[8.3 mmol/l\\] after initial stabilization\u201d\n    *   Treatment dose and route of insulin was at the treating physician\u2019s discretion\n*   **Arm 2**: No addition of fludrocortisone\n    *   Hydrocortisone was continued\n    *   Fludrocortisone was not administered\n    *   No placebo was administered either\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Physicians were advised to follow the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for all non-trial therapies\n*   Hydrocortisone was administered as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours to all patients for 7 days from recruitment\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Good separation between groups was achieved, with statistically significant lower blood glucose observed in the intervention group compared to the control group\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: There was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality between the Intensive Insulin Therapy and the Conventional Glucose Control\n    *   Intensive Insulin Therapy: in-hospital mortality 45.9%\n    *   Conventional Glucose Control: in hospital mortality 42.9%\n    *   Absolute Risk Increase: 2.97% (95% CI -5.66% to 11.60%; P = 0.53)\n    *   Relative Risk: 1.07 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.30)\n    *   Hazard Ratio (using time to death analysis and not just \u2018dead/alive\u2019): 1.04 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.34; P = 0.78)\n\n*   **Secondary outcome**:\n    *   There was no evidence of interaction with fludrocortisone (P = 0.31)\n        *   In-hospital mortality (with vs without): 42.9% vs 45.8%\n        *   Absolute Risk Reduction: 2.98% (95% CI\u00a0-5.66% to 11.61%)\n    *   No pre-defined subgroup analysis identified any benefit from intensive insulin therapy or fludrocortisone administration\n    *   Median length of stay in ICU and hospital was not different\n    *   Duration of vasopressor therapy and mechanical ventilation was not different\n    *   The incidence of hypoglycaemia was significantly higher in the Intensive Insulin Therapy group\n        *   Intensive Insulin Therapy: 16.4%\n        *   Conventional Glucose Control: 7.8%\n        *   Absolute Risk Increase: 8.6% (95% CI\u00a02.97% to 14.23%)\n        *   Number-needed-to-harm: 12\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   This trial provides no evidence to support intensive insulin therapy (blood glucose target 80 to 110 mg/dl \\[4.44 to 6.1 mmol/l\\] ) for patients with septic shock being treated with corticosteroids\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   The hypothesis is reasonable given the described theory (but note comment in Weaknesses below), and the\u00a0randomised, controlled trial design is arguably the best method to investigate this hypothesis\n*   The multi-centre design increases external generalisation\n*   The centralised, web-based randomisation process is the gold standard for concealing group allocation and preventing allocation bias\n*   The power calculation was based on previous data, although in retrospect it was over optimistic to expect the intervention to reduce mortality by 25%\n*   The statistical methods and intention-to-treat analysis plan were appropriate for the data types\n*   Attempts were made to standardise non-study care according to published guidelines, which may reduce any ascertainment bias due to the lack of blinding, although the compliance with this was not reported\n*   Good separation was demonstrated between the groups with regards to blood glucose levels, increasing the internal validity of the results\n*   The primary outcome is objective and binary, reducing observer bias and simplifying assessment and analysis\n*   The small confidence intervals around the null-effect point suggest that a true benefit or harm is unlikely, which strengthens the conclusion of this trial\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The hypothesis tested tight glucose control with a target of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l against less-tight glucose control with a target of < 8.3 mmol/l, which are arguably not that dissimilar and perhaps the theory has not been adequately tested with this trial\n    *   Compare this with [NICE-SUGAR](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nice-sugar/)\n        \u2018s relaxed glucose control with a target of 8.0 to 10.0 mmol/l\n*   The open-label design may introduce significant biases as clinical staff may unconsciously treat the patients differently depending upon their group allocation, which usually exaggerates the effect in favour of the intervention group\n*   The time-frame for the primary outcome \u2013 in-hospital events \u2013 introduces the possibility of distortion of the results due to \u2018clipping\u2019\n    *   If patients get home but still die more often then this significant outcome will be missed\n    *   30-day mortality is frequently used for a fairer assessment of outcome but this requires more trial resource to follow-up discharged patients\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial provides evidence against Intensive Insulin Therapy in patients administered hydrocortisone for septic shock, and furthermore there is no benefit from additional fludrocortisone\n*   The narrow confidence intervals suggest that any true benefit is small and this must be balanced against the significant incidence of hypoglycaemia (NNH 12)\n*   This adds to the theory regarding steroids in sepsis \u2013 if they are of benefit, counteracting the possibly harmful hyperglycaemia with tight glycaemic control does not make any difference to short-term patient outcomes compared to less-tight glycaemic control\n\n####

N Engl J Med 2008; 358:111-24.\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adult patients with severe septic shock, does hydrocortisone versus placebo reduce mortality at 28 days?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Multi-centre, randomised controlled trial\n*   Double-blinded\n*   Computer generated, block randomisation stratified by study centre.\n*   All patients had short corticotropin test to identify \u201cresponders\u201d from \u201cnon-responders\u201d for _a priori_\u00a0sub-group analysis.\n*   Adverse events data collected for safety analysis at blinded interim intervals.\n*   Power calculation: if 40% included were \u201cnon-responders\u201d with a baseline 28-day mortality of 50%, then 400 patients per arm were required to detect 10% absolute reduction in mortality with 80% power and 5% accepted type 1 error.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   52 participating ICUs\n*   March 2002 to November 2005\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: adults with severe sepsis, with all of the following:\n    *   clinical evidence of infection;\n    *   systemic response to inflammation;\n    *   shock (systolic BP < 90 mmHg despite 1 hour fluid resuscitation or the need for vasopressors);\n    *   organ dysfunction attributable to shock.\n*   Exclusion: chronic steroids within 6 months; acute steroids within 4 weeks; immunosupression; \u00a0less than 24 survival expectation\n*   499 patients recruited\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Hydrocortisone given as 50 mg in 6-hourly boluses\n    *   Tapering regime from day 6. Stopped on day 12.\n\n### Control\n\n*   Identical placebo prepared and administered in an identical way to intervention.\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: no difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin non-responders (i.e. the sub-group that were more likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)\n    *   39.2% in hydrocortisone group vs. 36.1% in placebo group\n    *   Absolute difference 3.1% (95% C.I. -9.5% to 15.7%) favouring placebo.\n    *   p=0.69\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   No difference in 28-day mortality in short corticotropin responders (i.e. the sub-group that were less likely to benefit from exogenous corticosteroids)\n        *   28.8% vs. 28.7%, P=1.0\n    *   No difference in 28-day mortality in all patients\n        *   34.3% vs. 31.5%, P=0.51\n    *   Statistically significant reduction in the time to reversal of shock favouring the hydrocortisone group (seen in responders, non-responders and all patient groups).\n        *   median time until reversal of shock, in all patients, was 3.3 days (95% C.I. 2.9-3.9) in the hydrocortisone group vs. 5.8 days (95% C.I. 5.2-6.9) in the placebo group\n    *   Non-significant increase in rate of superinfections in hydrocortisone vs. placebo group\n        *   33% vs. 26%, RR 1.27 (95% C.I. 0.96-1.68)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The use of hydrocortisone did not decrease mortality in a general population of patients with septic shock, even though the drug hastened reversal of shock\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Excellent randomisation and blinding methodology\n*   Sensible primary outcome, and useful secondard outcomes\n*   Fair commentary of problems by authors in \u2018Discussion\u2019 section of paper\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Despite 52 ICUs, this study failed to recruit required numbers (average of less than 10 patients per ICU over 3 years) despite common incidence of severe sepsis.\n*   Actually mortality (~38%) was much lower than estimated mortality used for power calculation (50%)\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study did not demonstrate survival benefit from administering hydrocortisone to adult patients with severe septic shock. It may lead to harm from superinfection. It does lead to reversal of shock quicker than placebo.\n*   Based on this study alone, hydrocortisone should not be routinely given to adult patients with severe septic shock.\n*   It may be worth considering when all else has failed.\n\n#### Links\n\n[Full text pdf](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa071366)\n / [abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa071366)\n / doi:\u00a010.1056/NEJMoa071366\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [The ADRENAL study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23931038)\n    : a trial of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis, aiming to recruit 3,800 patients to answer this same clinical question.\n*   [Mason et al.

DOI 10.1007/s00134-017-4911-0\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill adult patients who pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), does 1-hour rest compared with immediate extubation reduce re-intubation rates at 48 hours?\n\n### Background\n\n*   SBTs are used to assess if patients are likely to be successfully liberated from a mechanical ventilator. Post-extubation respiratory failure and the need for re-intubation occurs in 5-30% of patients. These patients have an increased risk of mortality. Respiratory muscles can become fatigued and it is hypothesised that a SBT can lead to fatigue and increase the probability of failure. This trial tried to determine if giving patients a period of rest following a SBT would lead to a higher success rate when liberating patients from a mechanical ventilator.\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n    *   Central randomisation with computerised random-number tables in blocks of 4\n    *   Stratified by centre and risk of extubation failure before SBT\n*   Allocation concealment maintained through numbered opaque envelopes\n*   Non-blinded\n*   Investigators who collected endpoints excluded from clinical decisions\n*   Registered with [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01915563)\n    \n*   Statistical analysis\n    *   Sample size calculation:\n        *   1372 patients required to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction in the intervention group from a 15% baseline, with a false negative rate of 20% and a false positive rate of 5%\n    *   Intention to treat analysis\n    *   Categorical variables compared with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel x2 or Fisher\u2019s exact test\n    *   Normally distributed continous variables compared with Student\u2019s t test\n    *   Non-normally distributed continous variables compared with Mann-Whitney U test\n    *   Multi-variate model assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve and the goodness of fit by Hosmer-Lemeshow test\n\n### Setting\n\n*   17 medical-surgical ICUs, Spain\n*   Data collected: October 2013 \u2013 January 2015\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Received invasive mechanical ventilation for \u226512 hours\n    *   Successfully completed a SBT (screened daily)\n*   Exclusion:\n    *   Age <18 years, tracheostomy, overwhelming respiratory secretions, inability to follow commands, do-not-resuscitate or re-intubate orders, formal indication for non-invasive ventilation after extubation\n*   470 patients randomised\n*   Comparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention groups\n    *   Age: 62 vs. 65, p=0.96\n    *   APACHE II: 18.3 vs. 17.8, p=0.41\n    *   Co-morbidities >1: 37% vs. 47%, p=0.03\n    *   Upper airway problems: 22% vs. 29%, p=0.08\n    *   COPD: 14% vs. 17%, p=0.58\n    *   \\> 1 failed SBT: 11% vs. 12%, p=0.75\n    *   Copious secretions: 15% vs. 9%, p=0.06\n    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation before SBT: 5.5 vs. 5.7 days, p=0.85\n    *   SBT technique\n        *   T-tube: 87% vs. 94%\n        *   Duration of SBT of 120min: 31.7% vs. 20.7%, p=0.009\n    *   High risk for requiring re-intubation: 83% vs. 84%\n        *   Defined as high risk if met any of the following criteria:\n            *   Age >65\n            *   Congestive heart failure as reason for intubated\n            *   COPD\n            *   APACHE II >12 on extubation day\n            *   BMI >30\n            *   Ineffective cough or copious respiratory secretions (>2 suctioning in the 8 hours before extubation)\n            *   \\>1 failed SBT\n            *   \\>1 co-morbidity\n            *   Problems related with upper airway (including intubation >7 days)\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Reconnected to ventilator for 1-hour\n    *   Post-successful completion of SBT\n    *   At previous ventilatory parameters\n    *   Then directly extubated\n    *   9 (3.7%) patients did not tolerate reconnection to the ventilator, and therefore directly extubated\n\n### Control\n\n*   Immediate extubation\n    *   Post successful competion of SBT\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Patients screened daily for SBT\n*   Criteria for assessing weanability by SBT:\n    *   Subjective: resolution of the acute phase of disease for which patient was intubated, adequate cough, absence of tracheobronchial secretions\n    *   Objective: HR <140, sBP 90-160 with no or minimal vasopressors, temp <38C, adequate level of consciousness, SpO2 >90% at FiO2 \u22640.4 and PEEP <8, RR<35, minute volume <10L/min and f/VT <105 breaths/min/L\n*   Technique for SBT (T-tube, low-level pressure support, continuous positive pressure airway pressure (CPAP) and duration (30, 60 or 120 min) at discretion of treating physician\n*   Successful SBT defined as:\n    *   Correct gas exchange (SpO2 \u226585-90%, PaO2 \u226550-60mmHg, FiO2 \u22640.4 pH \u22657.32, increase in PaCO2 <10mmHg),\n    *   Haemodynamic stability (HR <140, systolic BP <180-200mmHg and >90mmHg without vasopressors)\n    *   Stable ventilatory pattern (RR <30-35 and <150% from basal)\n*   The protocol at each participating hospital determined the treatment of post-extubation respiratory failure.

However, given the data come from two small RCTs and other observational studies with potentially significant biases, this conclusion is not certain and further trials should be performed.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Systematically designed and conducted review following established PRISMA guidelines\n*   Identified studies are recent and global\n*   Sensitivity analysis performed\n*   Did not over emphasise the strength of data from post-hoc analysis of RCTs\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Various drugs used as control for comparison\n    *   Ketamine in one RCT, midazolam in the other RCT, midazlolam in 1 retrospective cohort study\n    *   All other studies did not specify what the control for comparison was\n    *   Therefore the conclusion is that etomidate is neither better nor worse than _something_ else\n*   Secondary outcomes of resource use (length of stay and ventilation) could not be analysed due to the paucity of available data\n*   No attempt was made to contact the authors of the original trials\n    *   With only 18 studies no older than 13 years, this would not have been unreasonably difficult\n    *   Additional data may have provided information regarding the control drug and resource use\n    *   Individual patient meta-analysis may provide stronger certainty about the conclusion\n*   Assessment of bias\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This meta-analysis did not find evidence of harm from single-dose etomidate, but the trials on which it is based are small and the comparators are not clearly defined.\n*   Therefore, whilst there are alternative agents for cardio-stable induction, this trial does not provide evidence to support etomidate use over and above these other agents.\n*   Of note, the conclusion in this paper contradicts other recent meta-analyses (see link below)\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Single-Dose Etomidate Does Not Increase Mortality in Patients with Sepsis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies by Gu et al](http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1910194)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Rapid Sequence Intubation of the Shock Patient by LITFL](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/rapid-sequence-induction-of-the-shock-patient/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Etomidate is associated with mortality and adrenal insufficiency in sepsis: a meta-analysis by Chan](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22971586)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DuncanChambler](https://twitter.com/duncanchambler)\n  \nSummary date: 24th April 2015  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[RSI](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/rsi/)\n[Sedation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sedation/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/waterfall-6473754-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/uncategorized/prepare-ii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4210553-FAKT-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/fakt/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-1-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/mends2/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/gu-single-dose-etomidate-does-not-increase-mortality-in-patients-with-sepsis-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis-of-randomized-controlled-trials-and-observational-studies/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

beneficial for haemodynamically unstable patients in the acute stages of septic AKI\u201d\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Data collected prospectively\n*   Univariate and multivariate analysis conducted to confirm raw findings\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Retrospective observational study: suggests\u00a0_association_\u00a0not\u00a0_causation_\n*   Single centre and small numbers for observational study\n*   Arbitrary decision to perform EDHF or CVVHF depending on clinician\u2019s opinion\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study does not identify any significant reasons to consider EDHF as more beneficial than the conventional CVVHF.\n*   A large randomised, controlled trial will be needed to explore this further if the clinical question remains relevant (roughly 120\u00a0patients\u00a0per group\u00a0will be needed \u2013\u00a0at 80% power and alpha level of 0.05 based upon the\u00a0observed primary outcome values in this study)\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article

NEJM. 2014;370:1583-1593\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with septic shock does a high target mean arterial pressure (MAP), compared to a low target MAP, improve mortality?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n*   Stratified according to presence of chronic hypertension\n*   Open label\n*   Blinding of patients and research staff\n\n### Setting\n\n*   29 centres in France\n*   March 2010 \u2013 December 2011\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: adult patients with septic shock that was refractory to fluid resuscitation, and had been treated with >0.1mcg/kg adrenaline or noradrenaline for <6 hours at inclusion\n    *   Refractory to fluid resuscitation defined as lack of response to 30ml/kg of normal saline/colloids or clinician assessment based on invasive measures or echocardiography\n*   Exclusion: Pregnancy, decision not to resuscitate\n*   776 patients enrolled\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   target MAP 80-85\n    *   for maximum of 5 days or until weaned from vasopressor support\n    *   observed values were generally MAP 85-90\n\n### Control\n\n*   target MAP 65-70\n    *   observed values generally 70-75\n\nIn both intervention and control group, fluid resuscitation performed as recommended by French intensive care societies; with noradrenaline administered as a 1st line vasopressor in 28 centres, and adrenaline in 1 centre. The use of hydrocortisone and activated protein C was at the discretion of the treating physician. Diuretics prohibited except for \u2018compelling indications,\u2019 such as hypoxaemia secondary to sodium and water overload, or life-threatening hyperkalaemia.\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: mortality at 28 days \u2013 no significant difference\n    *   36.6% in high MAP group vs. 34% in low MAP group (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% C.I. 0.84-1.38, P=0.57)\n*   Secondary outcomes:\n    *   serious adverse events \u2013 no significant difference\n        *   19.1% vs. 17.8%, P=0.64\n    *   new atrial fibrillation \u2013 significantly greater in high MAP group\n        *   6.7% vs. 2.8%, P=0.02\n    *   90 day mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n        *   43.7% vs. 42.3%\n*   Sub-group analysis\u00a0in patients with chronic hypertension (n=340)\n    *   doubling of serum creatinine \u2013 significantly lower in the high MAP group\n        *   38.9% vs 52%, P=0.02, NNT 7.6\n    *   number that required renal replacement therapy from day 1-7 \u2013 significantly lower in the high MAP group\n        *   31.7% vs. 42.2%, P=0.046, NNT 9.5\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Targeting a MAP of 80-85, compared with 65-70 did not affect mortality\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Randomised\n*   Blinding of research staff\n*   Standard protocol for use of renal replacement therapy\n*   No significant difference in fluid intake between intervention and control group\n*   Clearly defined thresholds for renal replacement therapy\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Due to a lower mortality than predicted the study was under powered\n*   Frequent use of steroids and activated protein C may limit generalisability\n*   Achieved MAP was higher than target MAP, although this is common practice in many ICUs\n*   Less than 15 patients recruited per centre per year. For a common condition this is surprisingly low and may limit the external validity of the trial.\n*   The authors report 16.5% of patients in the high MAP group vs. 10.3% (P=0.01) in the low MAP group failed to achieve target BP because the attending clinician decided to limit the vasopressor infusion. Whilst this is an ethically important safety factor, this compliance bias will favour the null hypothesis.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   For the majority of patients in septic shock a target MAP of 65-70 is a good starting point. However, in patients with chronic hypertension I will target a higher MAP. This is because, even though this did not improve mortality, it did reduce the need for renal replacement therapy with a NNT of 9.5. A number of studies have previously demonstrated that the need for renal replacement therapy is associated with mortality.\n*   In patients without hypertension further studies comparing a MAP of 65 with a lower MAP of e.g. 55 would be beneficial\n\n#### Links\n\nFull text only available with subscription /\u00a0[abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1312173)\n / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1312173\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Resus.me](http://resus.me/blood-pressure-target-in-septic-shock/)\n    \n*   [Medical Evidence Blog](http://medicalevidence.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/lost-without-map-blood-pressure-targets.html)\n    \n*   Further reading\u00a0[Higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy in shock: a multicentre pilot randomized controlled trial \u2013 in patients >75 years a lower MAP resulted in a reduced mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891677)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 16 June 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ACORN-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/acorn/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/STRESS-L-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/stress-l/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   Pingback: [Pulmcrit Wee- Vasopressin vs. norepinephrine for vasoplegic shock after cardiac surgery](http://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/vasopressin-vancs/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/sepsispam/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

TXA did not reduce transfusion rates\n*   Only 5% of patients in both groups actually died of haemorrhage\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The absolute risk reduction in mortality with the use of TXA in trauma patients is very small. Neither did it reduce the amount of blood products administered. However, TXA is unlikely to cause harm and hence will continue to be part of practice in the management of the bleeding trauma patient\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events, and blood transfusion in trauma patients with significant haemorrhage (CRASH-2): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(10)60835-5.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Morrison JJ, Dubose JJ, Rasmussen TE, Midwinter MJ.

It would have been more useful if the primary outcome was a longer term outcome rather than the requirement for dialysis in the first week\n*   Information on outcome of other organs that were donated not stated\n*   No set criteria for when dialysis was performed\n*   The study randomised 394 patients (~788 kidneys) but only had data on 566 transplanted kidneys. This is a loss of 28% (n=222). Whilst mostly unavoidable (medical issues, withdrawal of consent, not transplanted, 2.7% data incomplete) their analysis is consequently not intention-to-treat and so may bias toward a positive outcome.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In organ donors, following death by neurological criteria, the use of therapeutic hypothermia vs. normothermia, significantly decreased the recipient\u2019s requirement for dialysis during the 1st week post-transplant. This benefit was more marked for patients at a higher risk of graft failure. Further studies are required to confirm this finding, \u00a0to demonstrate the longterm outcomes, and to investigate the outcomes for other organs that are transplanted.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[Therapeutic Hypothermia in Deceased Organ Donors and Kidney-Graft Function](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1501969)\n    \n*   \\[open access pdf of article\\]\u00a0[Therapeutic Hypothermia in Deceased Organ Donors and Kidney-Graft Function](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1501969)\n    \n*   \\[Supplementary Appendix\\]\u00a0[Supplementary Appendix](http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1501969/suppl_file/nejmoa1501969_appendix.pdf)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 8th August 2015  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@duncanchambler](https://twitter.com/duncanchambler)\n\n[Organ Donation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/organ-donation/)\n[Temperature Control](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/temperature-control/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PEXELS-490x280.webp)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/hypo-ecmo/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/icecube-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ttm2/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/hyperion/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/therapeutic-hypothermia-in-deceased-organ-donors-and-kidney-graft-function/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

N Engl J Med 2009; 360:1283-97.\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill adults that are expected to be in Intensive Care for 3 days or more, does intensively controlled blood glucose compared to conventionally controlled blood glucose reduce mortality at 90 days?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial.\n*   Stratified randomisation using minimisation algorithm for type of admission (operative vs non-operative) and geographical region.\n*   Allocation was appropriately concealed before randomisation.\n*   Treating clinicians were not blinded.\n*   Aimed to recruit 6,100 patients to provide a power of 90% to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 3.8%, assuming a baseline mortality of 30%, with an accepted two-sided alpha level of 0.05 or less.\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis method.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Medical and surgical ICUs across Australia and New Zealand (87.5%), and North America (12.5%).\n*   38 academic tertiary care hospitals and 4 community hospitals\n*   December 2004 to November 2008.\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Patients expected to require 3 or more days of care on an ICU, with an arterial line to allow blood sampling\n*   Exclusion: Admitted for DKA or hyperosmolar state; expected to be eating by day 3; high-risk of hypoglycaemia such as insulin-secreting tumour or fulminant liver failure.\n*   40,171 were screened. 6,104 patients were recruited.\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   _Intensive-control_: control of blood glucose to a level between 4.5 and 6.0 mmol/L (81 and 108 mg/dL).\n    *   Insulin in saline was administered to keep glucose less than 6.0 mmol/L (108 mg/dL)\n    *   This was titrated to blood glucose, and stopped if it fell below 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL)\n    *   The intervention was stopped when patients were eating, discharged from ICU, deceased or 90 after randomisation\n    *   97.2% required insulin during the trial\n    *   Mean time-weighted blood glucose level was 6.4 mmol/L (115 mg/dL).\n\n### Control\n\n*   _Conventional-control_: control of blood glucose to a level less than 10.0 mmol/L (180mg/dL)\n    *   Insulin in saline was administered to keep glucose less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL)\n    *   This was titrated to blood glucose, and stopped if it fell below 8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL)\n    *   The intervention was stopped when patients were eating, discharged from ICU, deceased or 90 after randomisation\n    *   69.0% required insulin during the trial\n    *   Mean time-weighted blood glucose level was 8.0 mmol/L (144 mg/dL).\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: There was a statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality that favoured conventional-control.\n    *   Intensive-control: 27.5%\n    *   Conventional-control: 24.9%\n    *   Absolute difference: 2.6% (95% CI 0.4-4.8)\n    *   Odds ration for death with intensive control: 1.14 (95% CI 1.02-1.29; p=0.02)\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   No difference in\n        *   the mortality rate at 28 days\n        *   the median length of stay in ICU or hospital\n        *   the development of new organ failure\n        *   the number of days of mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy\n        *   the rates of red-cell tranfusion or positive blood culture\n    *   a significant difference in\n        *   the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (6.8% in intensive-control; 0.5% in conventional-control)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   A blood glucose target of less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) resulted in lower mortality than a target of 4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L (81 to 108 mg/dL), and the authors do not recommend use of the lower target in critically ill adults.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Well designed, pragmatic study designed to answer a clinically relevant research question.\n*   2.4% withdrew consent and 0.3% were lost-to-follow-up: negligible attrition bias.\n*   99.5% were administered the correct management according to the study algorith: stengthens the internal validity (accuracy) of the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The treatment was discontinued prematurely in 10.0% of patients in the intervention group and 7.4% in the conventional-control group. The most common reasons were physician decision or a change to palliative care. This difference may have introduced bias to the results, especially as the clinicians were unblinded. These rates are lower than the primary outcome incidence, and are therefore unlikely to change the direction of the primary outcome, but may have exaggerated the effect size.\n*   More patients in the intensive-control group received corticosteroids (34.6% vs 31.7%; p=0.02). This may affect the measured outcome, but predicting how and to what extent is not possible.\n*   The median blood glucose level achieved in the intensive-control group was 6.4 mmol/L, which is above the target range of 4.5 to 6.0 mmol/L. This demonstrates the difficulty in achieving this target range, and it may reduce the observed difference between the two groups.\n*   The majority of patients received nutrition via enteral feeding routes, perhaps reducing generalisability to patients being fed parenterally.\n*   The authors do not attempt to explain why there was a difference in mortality at 90 days, but not at 28 days. Why should intensive-control of blood glucose have a harmful effect on _late_ survival odds?\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial demonstrates better survival if a _conventional_ blood glucose target of less than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) is used in critically ill patients.  \n    The trial\u2019s strong internal validity and external generalisability suggests this should be used in clinical practice in developed countries for adult patients.\n\n#### Links\n\n[Full text pdf](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625)\n / [abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810625)\n / doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0810625\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Inzucchi and Siegel.

Vasopressin (0.04 units/min) was added \u00a0followed by phenylephrine or epinephrine if the target MAP was not achieved\n*   enteral nutrition was commenced 24 hours after ICU admission and once clinical stability was achieved\n*   deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with both enoxaparin (or heparin in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) and sequential compression\n*   permissive hyperglycaemia was allowed\n*   Routine stress ulcer prophylaxis was not administered\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: Hospital mortality\n    *   8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p < 0.001)\n\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   mean duration of vasopressor therapy: 18.3 \u00b1 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol vs 54.9 \u00b1 28.4 hours in the control group P<0.001\n    *   requirement for renal replacement therapy in patients with AKI: 3 patients (10%) in the treatment group vs 11 (37%) in the control group P=0.02\n    *   median ICU length of stay: 4 days in both groups\n    *   PCT clearance (initial PCT minus PCT at 72 hours divided by the initial PCT multiplied by 100): 86.4% in the treatment group vs 33.9% in the control group\n    *   The 72-hour delta SOFA score (difference between subsequent scores) was 4.8 \u00b1 2.4 in the treatment group compared to 0.9 \u00b1 2.7 in the control group (p<0.001).\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   An interesting hypothesis generating study which has some biologically plausible explanations for benefit in sepsis\n*   Vitamin C and thiamine are cheap and relatively safe. However, vitamin C toxicity can cause renal failure and the safety profile would be best evaluated in the context of an RCT\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Not an RCT\n*   Small numbers\n*   Single centre\n*   Multiple interventions and therefore not possible to determine which, if any, are associated with improved outcome\n*   The treatment and control periods were not concurrent and occurred during different seasons\n*   60% of patients in the control group were treated with corticosteroids\n*   Details are provided for the underlying reason for death (including advanced dementia, severe heart failure, advanced sarcoidosis and severe COPD) but not for the control group\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study is hypothesis generating. An RCT is required to determine the efficacy of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine in severe sepsis and septic shock. The results of ADRENAL will help guide future use of corticosteroids. I will not consider using vitamin C or thiamine in sepsis until additional studies, demonstrating benefit, are completed. Until then, I will eagerly wait to see if the combination of vitamin C, steroids and thiamine offers a \u2018Marikle\u2019 cure for sepsis\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\]\u00a0[Hydrocortisone, Vitamin C and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Retrospective Before-After Study](http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=2593508)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [A randomized clinical trial of ascorbic acid in open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair](https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40635-015-0050-5)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ADjunctive coRticosteroid trEatment iN criticAlly ilL Patients With Septic Shock (ADRENAL)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01448109)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Effect of high-dose ascorbic acid on vasopressor requirement in septic shock](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843590/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Vitamin S (Steroids) and Vitamin C for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock!](http://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Citation/2016/06000/_Vitamin_S___Steroids__and_Vitamin_C_for_the.24.aspx)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Vitamin C revisited](http://www.ccforum.com/content/18/1/460)\n    \n*   \\[blog post\\]\u00a0[PulmCrit- Metabolic sepsis resuscitation: the evidence behind Vitamin C](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/metabolic-sepsis-resuscitation/)\n    \n*   \\[podcast\\] [EMCrit Wee \u2013 Edited Version of Paul Marik on the Metabolic Resuscitation of Sepsis](https://emcrit.org/wee/edited-marik-metabolic-sepsis/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n  \nSummary date: 31st Jan 2017  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[Adrian Wong](http://www.twitter.com/Avkwong)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Shock](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/shock/)\n[Steroids](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/steroids/)\n[Vitamins](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/vitamins/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 12 comments\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7d6726ab42b006ea96b1f0be0a91afe3?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Cg\n    \n    [3 February 2017 at 9:46 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/marik/#comment-522)\n    \n    [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02106975](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02106975)\n    \n    Clinical trial prospective randomized at clinical trials.gov of vitamin c in acute lung injury\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/marik/?replytocom=522#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49851ced9a1cfa8ba0512cef29d4ed3a?s=56&d=mm&r=g) [Matthew](http://rollcagemedic.com)\n    \n    [3 April 2017 at 12:38 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/marik/#comment-549)\n    \n    Hi Steve,\n    \n    Great summary as usual. There is a storming debate over on EMCrit/PulmCrit following Josh Farkas\u2019 in-depth review of the same paper that is worth heading over to for a read.\n    \n    I accept all of the pro and con criticisms that have been laid out, yet I come to a different practice decision. I agree that a small, before-and-after, single centre trial of itself should be no more than hypothesis generating. However, Paul\u2019s trial builds upon pre-existing work. I want to see the RCT and we might look at doing something here in Wollongong (likely to be no more than a single centre though), however, here\u2019s the thing; we still need to make the best decisions that we can based on the current best information available.\n    \n    We\u2019ve been suckered before with \u2018magic bullets\u2019 that then appear to fail at MC-RCT level, including steroids. And many have significant ADR profiles. Vitamin C may ultimately fail the \u2018gold standard\u2019 trial but in the meantime there is a negligible ADR profile associated with it. Critics will (and have) brought up the usual spectres of Hawthorne effect, small sample sizes and dissecting the effects of packaged therapies (Marik\u2019s Marikle compound consists of Vit C + Thiamine + Steroid), yet how many patients are currently in ICUs already receiving thiamine and steroids? Why not start with an RCT on that cohort? And while that is getting coordinated, for the centres that do not get involved in that RCT, think about setting up a registry? This is ultimately not much different from post marketing surveillance that occurs for drugs and devices that get FDA/TGA/etc approval.\n    \n    Here\u2019s the argument put forward by an intensivist (Tim Baptist) on the PulmCrit site:\n    \n    Universe 1: Cocktail works  \n    \u2013 Early adopters: Saved lives  \n    \u2013 Skeptics: Lost lives that could have been saved  \n    Universe 2: Cocktail doesn\u2019t work  \n    \u2013 Early adopters; No lives saved; No to minimal harm done.  \n    \u2013 Skeptics; No lives saved. No harm done.\n    \n    It has also been put forward that perhaps ADRENAL will be a negative trial if the Vit C component turns out to be true and if that is not examined, we might throw away a helpful therapy.\n    \n    Fascinating topic ultimately \u2013 as much for the debate as the itherapy itself. And if it does prove successful, let\u2019s hope that your coined term \u201cMarikle therapy\u201d gets adopted.\n    \n    Thanks\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/marik/?replytocom=549#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5aef80c0ce543b3692f523ed96c2fce3?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Steve Mathieu\n    \n    [3 April 2017 at 9:00 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/marik/#comment-550)\n    \n    Thanks Matt\n    \n    It\u2019s been a fascinating study and debate.\n    \n    I have a few issues with the study (others highlighted in the post):\n    \n    1) The mortality in the control group is very high. Rivers was only 6% higher 15 years ago. The EGDT studies had a 60 or 90 day mortality of 18.8% (ARISE); 18.2% (ProCESS) and 29.2% (ProMISE). It\u2019s not clear why the control mortality is so high but this will exaggerate any difference in the experimental group\n    \n    2) The manuscript provides details of the 4 patients that died during their hospital stay, reporting that their death was not attributed to complications from sepsis. What about the control group?\n    \n    3) The belief that this therapy is harmless may be influencing opinions on whether an RCT with adverse event reporting is required. Whilst I accept that it probably does have limited side effects, we simply do not know (who would have thought that oxygen could be harmful?) Most studies (accepting Zabet and Fowler are important exceptions) have used the oral route for vitamin C and interactions with other drugs, treatments and pathologies may ultimately prove harmful. We also know from several previous studies that steroids might increase the risk of secondary infections. ADRENAL will be helpful to inform us of this\n    \n    4) No information is provided about timing and method of any procedural or surgical source control\n    \n    My view is an RCT is required to make sure we have conducted a robust study, that is powered to report important patient outcome measures. I feel uncomfortable that we may adopt a treatment based on a single centred before and after trial with such small numbers and high risk of bias. Equally, I understand why some will wish to adopt it immediately. The risk is that we may well end up with a treatment that has no effect but (possibly) no harm right now. Moreover, in the future, we may end up with this treatment ingrained in medical practice, and it does cause harm by drug interactions, toxicity or reducing the efficacy of new drug therapies.\n    \n    A prospective multi-centre cohort study may be the answer Matt.

The reason why there is so much skepticism about vitamin C in general, including intravenous vitamin C, is because people think of it as a mere nutrient. Intravenous vitamin C, which increases blood ascorbates way beyond oral administration, compared to oral vitamin C (regardless how much consumed, be it from an orange or supplement) is like comparing a glass of fine wine to a grape somebody stepped on. They\u2019re not even in the same realm.

As the authors state this can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy as treatment is withdrawn on the basis of this test, and the withdrawal of treatment itself can lead to a poor outcome.\n*   We are not told the length of time that physicians waited before determining that the effect of sedatives had been cleared\n*   It is not stated if clinicians determining primary outcome were blinded to tests of interest\n*   The study found disagreement between reviewers interpreting SEP results. However, we are not told the Kappa score (inter-rater agreement)\n*   The post-hoc analysis included only a small number of patients. Bias may also have been introduced by asking clinicians to perform a re-analysis.\n*   With only moderate numbers of patients included in the study the confidence intervals for some of the results are relatively wide.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest the use of clinical examination at 72 hours,\u00a0neuronspecific enolase and\u00a0somatosensory-evoked potentials can help predict a poor outcome. The methodological limitations and wide confidence intervals mean that I would not use a single test to predict a poor outcome and will continue to use a multimodal approach as recommended by the [ERC/ESICM](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-014-3470-x)\n    \n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Prognosis of coma after therapeutic hypothermia: a prospective cohort study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22367993)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: An advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-014-3470-x)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[The NNT: Likelihood ratios](http://www.thennt.com/diagnostics-and-likelihood-ratios-explained/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[American Clinical Neurophysiology Society: Guidelines on Short-Latency Somatosensory Evoked Potentials](http://www.acns.org/pdf/guidelines/Guideline-9D.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ROC Curves](http://gim.unmc.edu/dxtests/roc3.htm)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 15th April 2015  \nPeer-review editor: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Cardiac Arrest](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiac-arrest/)\n[Temperature Control](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/temperature-control/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/milad-fakurian-58Z17lnVS4U-unsplash-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/validation-of-the-miracle-2-score-for-prognostication-after-oohca/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/arrest-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/arrest-2/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/prognosis-of-coma-after-therapeutic-hypothermia-a-prospective-cohort-study/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The decision to\u00a0give rescue thrombolysis appeared to be at the discretion of the blinded physician as oppose to strict criteria. Indications for rescue thrombolysis included dyspnoea\u00a0or persistent RV dysfunction. At the time of the study these were not standard indications for thrombolysis.\n*   Under-powered. Trial was stopped early following an interim analysis which found a statistically significant improvement. Stopping at an interim analysis for a positive outcome will tend to exaggerate the effect size due to normal statistical variation\n*   Conflicts of interest: Boehringer gave statistical advice\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Thrombolysis for sub-massive PE decreased the requirement for rescue thrombolysis but did not affect mortality or adverse events. i.e giving thrombolysis early meant that you were less likely to need to give it later.\n*   Further evidence is required before this treatment can be recommended.\n\n#### Links\n\n[Full text pdf](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa021274)\n\u00a0/\u00a0[abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021274)\n\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMMoa021274\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Life in the fast lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/thrombolysis-submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n*   [RAGE podcast](http://ragepodcast.com/tag/submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 25 June 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/pulmonary-embolism/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/peg-ed/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ivc-filters/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/optalyse-pe/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/mappett-3/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) if successful SAT, performed as per control group (described below)\n\n### Control\n\n*   Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) if suitable each morning:\n    *   Process: breathing for 2 hours on any one of:\n        *   Pressure supported ventilation (PSV) of less than 7 cmH2O\n        *   Continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP) of 5 cmH2O\n        *   T-tube circuit\n    *   Criteria for failure were:\n        *   Tachypnoea > 35/min or Bradypnoea < 8/min\n        *   Hypoxaemia SpO2 < 88%\n        *   Acute mental status change\n        *   Acute cardiac arrhythmia\n        *   Any two signs of respiratory distress (tachycardia > 130 bpm; bradycardia < 60 bpm; accessory muscle use; abdominal paradoxical movement; diaphoresis; marked dyspnoea)\n    *   Contraindications:\n        *   no spontaneous respiratory effort\n        *   inadequate oxygenation (SpO2<88% or FiO2>0.5 or PEEP>8)\n        *   raised ICP\n        *   MI in previous 24 hours\n        *   agitation\n        *   significant vasopressors (Dop/Dob>5mcg/kg/min, NA>2mcg/min, vasopressin, milrinone)\n    *   If successful SBT, then clinicians had final decision regarding extubation\n\nBoth groups were sedated the same:\n\n*   Patient-targeted sedation to a \u201clevel of arousal and comfort deemed clinically appropriate for each patient\u201d\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: addition of SAT expedited weaning from mechanical ventilation\n    *   Increase in \u2018ventilator-free days\u2019 (mean days 14.7 \\[SD 0.0\\] v. 11.6 \\[0.9\\] p=0.02).\n*   Secondary outcomes:\n    *   Significantly faster discharge from ICU (median days 9.1 \\[IQR 5.1-17.8\\] v. 12.9 \\[6.0-24.2\\] p=0.01).\n    *   Significantly faster discharge from hospital (median days 14.9 \\[8.9-26.8\\] v. 19.2 \\[10.3 to (>25% not discharged by 28 days)\\] p=0.04).\n    *   Trend towards reduced 28-day mortality (28% v. 35% p=0.21).\n    *   Significantly reduced 1-year mortality (44% v. 55% p=0.01).\n    *   Significantly reduced duration of coma RASS -4/-5 (median days 2 \\[0-4\\] v. 3 \\[1-7\\] p=0.002).\n    *   No difference in duration of delirium based on CAM-ICU score (median days 2 \\[0-5\\] v. 2 \\[0-6\\] p=0.5).\n*   Complications:\n    *   Significantly more frequent self-extubation (10% v. 4%. p=0.03).\n    *   Not-significant reduction in frequency of tracheostomy (13% v. 20% p=0.06).\n    *   No difference in re-intubation rate (14% v. 13% p=0.73) even after self-extubation (3% v. 2% p=0.47)\n    *   Subsequent analysis showed no long-term psychological of functional differences\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   \u201c\u2026use of a so-called wake up and breathe protocol that pairs daily spontaneous awakening trials (ie, interruption of sedatives) with daily spontaneous breathing trials for the management of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care results in better outcomes than current standard approaches and should become routine practice.\u201c\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Addresses a widely applicable topic\n*   Pragmatic design\n*   Easy to replicate\n*   Appropriate randomisation\n*   Similar baseline characteristics both demographically and clinically\n*   Good follow-up (99%)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Potential biases inherent in study design:\n    *   Several eligible patients (a proportion of 324) were not enrolled due to physician refusal.\n    *   The performance of the study was necessarily unblinded and level of sedation and timing of extubation was at the clinicians discretion.\n*   Complicated statistical analysis including bootstrapping was employed due to the unusual distribution of the variable. These make interpretation of the study\u2019s findings more difficult.\n*   The mechanism of the observed survival benefit is difficult to explain.\n*   Rates of re-intubation (14% vs. 13%) and tracheostomy (13% vs. 20%) were high.\n*   Generalisability:\n    *   No surgical patients were included due to their need for continuous analgesia.\n    *   Does the control group represent common practice? Modern practice targets lighter sedation than was common at the time.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The use of SATs during this trial appears to expedite weaning from mechanical ventilation, but the study findings may potentially reflect greater levels of oversedation in the control group or a bias towards early extubation in the intervention group. Their use may be associated with greater risk of self-extubation and increased nursing workload\n\n### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[Efficacy and safety of a paired sedation and ventilator weaning protocol for mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care (Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial): a randomised controlled trial by Girard et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60105-1)\n    \n*   \\[editorial\\]\u00a0[Sedation in the intensive-care unit: good and bad? by Brochure](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60082-3)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Sedation in ICU by Life in the Fast Lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/sedation-in-icu/)\n    \n\n### Metadata\n\nSummary author: Barnaby Dykes for the University Hospital Southampton GICU Journal Club (edited by [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n)  \nSummary date: 5th December 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Sedation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sedation/)\n[Ventilation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/ventilation/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TAME-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/blog/ebm/tame/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vent-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/the-rest-trial/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   Pingback: [Reconnect \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/reconnect/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/abc/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The light could be turned off and on in the room and could be changed to bright settings of 1000 lux for emergencies and procedures\n\n### For both intervention and control group\n\n*   Identical lighting system (Philips Dynalite DUS804C, Philips Lighting) was installed in every ICU room\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome:\u00a0Cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired delirium (comparing intervention and control)\n    *   No significant difference (38% vs 33%, Odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0/92-1.68, p=0.16)\n*   Secondary outcomes: comparing intervention\u00a0vs. control group\n    *   No statistically significant difference in any of the outcome measures\n        *   Delirium free days: 26 vs 27 (P=0.29)\n        *   Duration of mechanical ventilation: 20h vs 19hr (P=0.67)\n        *   Length of ICU stay: 4 days vs 4 days (P=0.82)\n        *   ICU mortality: 12% vs 14% (P=0.42)\n        *   Length of hospital stay: 15 days vs 16 days (P=0.84)\n    *   No significant difference on further analysis in:\n        *   Use of sedative agents\n        *   Use of haloperidol\n        *   Hospital mortality\n        *   Excretion profile of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin or cortisol (biochemical markers of circadian rhythm)\n*   Mean cumulative daytime lighting levels between 0600h and 1800h were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group: 5366 vs 2793 lux (P<0.0001). Outside this period, mean lux was similar in both groups\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In critically ill patients\u00a0the use of continuous lighting therapy was not effective in reducing the cumulative incidence or the duration of ICU-acquired delirium compared to normal lighting.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   RCT\n*   Separation of intervention and control light profile achieved\n*   CAM-ICU score is recognised and validated for use of assessing delirium. This was measured three times each day\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Single centre\n*   Main exclusion criteria was that the patient was expected to spend < 24h on ICU. Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in both groups 19-20h which is short\n*   Incidence of delirium in control group lower than that used for power calculations\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Dynamic light therapy at supranormal levels conferred no benefit above natural lighting. Delirium on the ICU remains common and difficult to treat. I will continue my usual practice of daily sedation breaks, early mobilisation and orientation therapy on the ICU\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Dynamic light application therapy to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in intensive-care patients: a randomised controlled trial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(16)00025-4/abstract)\n    \n*   \\[FOAMed\\]\u00a0[Sleep and ICU](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/sleep-and-icu/)\n    \n*   \\[FOAMed\\]\u00a0[http://ICUdelirium.co.uk](http://ICUdelirium.co.uk)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[\u2018In a dark place, we find ourselves\u2019: light intensity in critical care units](https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40635-017-0122-9)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@avkwong](http://www.twitter.com/avkwong)\n  \nSummary date: 6th February 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Delirium](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/delirium/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Humanising ICU](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/humanising-icu/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 3 comments\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b70363d0a3e7e0af814bdc7acda3ae8e?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Duncan Chambler\n    \n    [17 February 2017 at 11:02 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#comment-526)\n    \n    Adrian, thanks for your summary and critique. This is a fascinating theory, which unfortunately this trial has not supported.\n    \n    From the data you\u2019ve presented (I admit I haven\u2019t had a chance to read the paper yet), it appears they did not recruit the number of patients they intended to. As the incidence of delirium was 38% vs 33%, the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) is 5% (which is smaller than the 10% they deemed clinically relevant in their power calculation). By recruiting only 75% of their target, the 95% CI for this ARI are -1.62% to 12.14% (i.e. the null hypothesis cannot be rejected), but if they had continued to 1000 patients and if the incidence remained the same in each group, then the 95% CI would have been 0.81% to 9.19%. From this, we might have concluded that dynamic light therapy is harmful, causing delirium in 1 patient for every 20 treated (i.e. NNH 20).\n    \n    Therefore, I think this trial is unable to conclude that dynamic light therapy has no effect on delirium but I completely agree with you that this trial demonstrates it does not have a clinically meaningful positive impact on delirium, unfortunately.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/?replytocom=526#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c3e73bf56cff907abc4195faf9554ac?s=56&d=mm&r=g) [avkwong](http://gravatar.com/avkwong)\n    \n    [18 February 2017 at 8:49 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#comment-527)\n    \n    Agree with power calculations.\n    \n    I think its an interesting theory though and as you say, its disappointing results. Given the drive for non-pharmacological interventions e.g. orientation therapy for delirium. My unit is located in the basement of the hospital with little natural light (Unlike Steve\u2019s unit). I do think the lack of light not only affects patients, but also staff. It would be very interesting to do a bit and after if/when we move to a new unit build.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/?replytocom=527#respond)\n    \n*   Pingback: [Nishikimi \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nishikimi/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

 *   31.2% v 15.8% (p < 0.0001)\n    *   This was significantly higher in non diabetic patients, but not for diabetic patients\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Targeting a patient\u2019s usual glycaemic level did not show a survival benefit compared to conventional control and targeting a glycaemic level of 180 mg/dL\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Double blinded trial in an area of critical care with few randomised trials despite the frequency with which parameters for blood glucose control are set for ICU patients\n*   Balanced baseline characteristics between groups\n*   Minimal protocol violations (<1%)\n*   Blinding methods minimise performance and detection bias\n*   Minimal loss to follow up (n=9)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Trial ended early prior to enrolment of calculated sample size\n*   Time lag bias as data collected in 2016 but not published until 2021\n*   Large numbers not assessed for exclusion criteria may result in selection bias\n*   The allowance of 96 hours following ICU admission for enrolment is a long time in the critically unwell\n    *   The intervention group received the same target as the conventional group until randomisation (<180mg/dL) results in contamination bias\n    *   Patients in the intervention group spent 26% of their ICU stay without an individualised target (and exposed to a target of 180 mg/dL)\n*   The authors postulate that insulin resistance may change over critical illness\n    *   If this is true, does the use a value that reflects glycaemic control over the three months prior to critical illness provide the best method for targeting personalised glycaemic control whilst critically unwell?\n*   The algorithm used was not validated prior to it\u2019s use\n*   The mean difference in time-weighted blood glucose was only 13 mg/dL between groups (0.7mmol/L) (eTable 3). It is unlikely this is clinically relevant\n    *   However if stratified by HbA1c there was statistical separation in time-weighted blood glucose for all HbA1c levels except between 7 and 8% (which was expected as an HbA1c of 7.4% = a target of 180mg/dL)\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Until better evidence becomes available surrounding personalised glycaemic targets in ICU, I will continue to adopt a conventional target for all patients\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[editorial\\] [The goal of personalized glucose control in the critically ill remains elusive](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-021-06530-y)\n    \n*   \\[article\\] [CONTROLING Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-021-06526-8#citeas)\n    \n*   \\[IBCC\\] [Stress Hyperglycaemia in the ICU](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/glucose/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: George Walker @hgmwalker89  \nSummary date: 7th December 2021  \nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\nPicture by: Pixabay\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Glucose](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/glucose/)\n[Glycaemic Control](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/glycaemic-control/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/controling/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

American Journal of Cardiology: 2013; 111(2)273-277.\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with moderate Pulmonary Embolism (PE), does low dose thrombolysis\u00a0+ anticoagulation, compared with anticoagulation alone, reduce pulmonary artery pressure at 28 months?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n*   Patients and clinicians non-blinded\n*   Blinding of cardiologists who determined result of primary outcome\n*   Powered at 90% to detect 10% reduction in pulmonary artery pressure with 5% accepted alpha error if 110 patients randomised.

Underpowered to determine differences in mortality\n*   Confidence intervals not reported\n*   Older definition of \u2018sub-massive\u2019 using anatomical rather than functional criteria. Only 21% of patients had RV enlargement and 6% had RV hypokinesia which are criteria used in most \u00a0definitions of submassive PE. The included population may therefore be a lower-risk cohort than other trials investigating \u2018intermediate-risk\u2019 PEs.\n*   Trial was not registered on clinicaltrials.gov\n*   Target APTR for control group was lower than in other trials. Were they under-treated?\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The addition of low dose thrombolysis in moderate PE decreased pulmonary artery systolic pressure by an average of 15mmHg at 28 months. Other studies will need to tell us if this is clinically relevant. A larger study is also required to determine if this benefit is offset by the potential risks from thrombolysis.\n\n#### Links\n\n*   Full text only available with subscription\n*   [abstract](http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(12)02205-9/abstract)\n    \u00a0\n*   doi: 10.1016/j.amjcard.2012.09.27\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [EMCrit](http://emcrit.org/wee/mopett-trial/)\n    \n*   [Life in the Fast Lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/thrombolysis-submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 26 June 2014  \nPeer-review editor: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/pulmonary-embolism/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/peg-ed/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ivc-filters/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/optalyse-pe/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/mopett/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

As energy and protein are likely to have a synergistic effect, this is difficult to interpret how this might affect the results.\n*   There was a significant loss of data at discharge for primary and secondary outcome variables. This highlights the difficulty in getting such measures in ICU nutrition or function trials.\n*   Single centre\n*   Change in primary outcome\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In critically ill adults patients receiving parenteral nutrition, this trial did not show any difference in hand grip strength at ICU discharge, with\u00a0amino acid delivery of 1.1g/kg vs 0.9g/kg. \u00a0Changes in other outcomes were minor, with differences disappearing later in ICU admission or failing to reach statistical significance. This is a small study and practice changes can not be recommended. It will be interesting to explore in larger trials if any of these changes in functional or muscle outcomes reach clinical or statistical significance.

NEJM 2015;372(11):997-1008. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1403612\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adults undergoing cardiac surgery, does a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hb > 75 g/l) compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (Hb > 90 g/l) lead to fewer infections and ischaemic events within 3 months?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial\n*   Secure online allocation process with complete concealment\n*   Allocation minimisation to balance assignment by centre and surgery\n*   Clinicians not blinded, but patients and investigators were\n    *   Patients were asked if they thought they knew their allocation at:\n        *   discharge: \u00a015.1% believed they did and 75.6% were correct\n        *   3 months: 27.5% believed they did and 56.6% were correct\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis\n*   Power analysis concluded 1468 patients needed to have 90% power with two-sided 5% level of significance\n    *   Increased to 2000 to allow for non-adherence\n    *   Based upon estimate of primary outcome of:\n        *   restrictive group 11%\n        *   liberal group 17%\n\n### Setting\n\n*   17 cardiac surgery centres across the UK\n*   July 2009 to February 2013\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: over 16 years undergoing non-emergency cardiac surgery\n    *   Patients recruited and consented prior to surgery but only randomised and included if their Hb was recorded at below 90 g/l at any post-operative time\n*   Exclusion: patients unwilling to receive blood products (e.g. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses), congenital or acquired platelet, red cell or clotting disorders, sepsis, critical limb ischaemia, emergency surgery (occurring on same day as admission)\n*   3565 consented, 2007 became anaemic and were randomised, 2003 analysed\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Restrictive transfusion-threshold\n    *   Threshold of 75 g/l\n    *   1 unit packed red cells transfused if threshold breached\n    *   Repeated as needed if remained or dropped below 75 g/l again\n\n### Control\n\n*   Liberal transfusion-threshold\n    *   Threshold of 90 g/dl\n    *   1 unit packed red cells transfused immediately after randomisation\n    *   Repeated as needed if remained or dropped below 90 g/l again\n\n#### Treatment common to both groups\n\n*   Treating physicians could contravene the assigned threshold and administer / withhold a transfusion, but only with clear documentation of the reason\n*   Treating physicians could permanently discontinue adherence to the assigned threshold\n    *   Data were still collected as per intention-to-treat\n*   All other aspects of management were as per the treating centre\u2019s usual care\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: there was no statistically significant difference in the composite outcome of serious infections or ischaemic events within 3 months\n    *   This outcome required the event to occur within the index hospital admission, or to have resulted in re-admission, or through detection by postal or phone survey of patients at home\n    *   Restrictive transfusion group 35.1% vs Liberal transfusion group 33.0%\n        *   Odds ratio 1.11 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.34); p-value 0.30\n        *   Absolute risk increase 2.11% (95% CI -2.14% to 6.36%)\n        *   Number needed to harm (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 48\n*   **Secondary outcome**: the only secondary outcome\u00a0(other than the dependent variable of red cell transfusions)\u00a0to demonstrate a statistically significant difference was death at 90 days (according to a Cox proportional regression analysis) which favoured a liberal transfusion strategy\n    *   Red cells transfused: liberal 95% vs restrictive 64%\n        *   Number needed to prevent transfusion (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 4\n    *   Occurrence of infection: liberal 25% vs restrictive 25%\n    *   Occurrence of an ischaemic event: liberal 14% vs restrictive 16%\n    *   Median duration of ICU stay, HDU stay and hospital stay (see table)\n    *   All cause mortality at 90 days: liberal 1.9% vs restrictive 2.6%\n        *   p-value 0.045\n        *   Number need to harm (by a restrictive transfusion practice) is 63\n    *   Significant pulmonary complications: liberal 12% vs 13%\n    *   EQ-5D health status: no statistical difference between groups or before and after surgery!\n*   **Tertiary data**:\n    *   Severe non-adherence to protocol: liberal 6.2% vs restrictive 9.7%\n    *   Proportion of patients that suspected they knew their allocation at 3 months: liberal 26% vs restrictive 29%\n        *   The proportion of these that were correct: liberal 45% vs restrictive 68%\n\n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vbk_kVl7mzg/VSWL2pUNLII/AAAAAAAAD-s/bklzQAFEWLk/s1600/TITRe2%2Bdata%2Btable.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vbk_kVl7mzg/VSWL2pUNLII/AAAAAAAAD-s/bklzQAFEWLk/s1600/TITRe2%2Bdata%2Btable.png)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The authors concluded that a restrictive transfusion strategy did not demonstrate clinical (or financial \u2013 data not presented here) superiority over a liberal transfusion strategy.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Important clinical question in a population not previous investigated through studies like [TRICC](http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/index.php?id=7462686622506815590)\n    , [TRISS](http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/index.php?id=4919825102268844793)\n     or [Villanueva](http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/index.php?id=8999282330351501733)\n    *   Patients in this trial had cardiovascular disease (although they were \u2018treated\u2019 for this during the index admission)\n    *   Therefore, it might be reasonable to extrapolate these findings to unwell patients with cardiovascular disease (such as acute coronary syndrome)\n*   Very well planned and executed clinical research\n*   Attempts to blind pragmatically, and effort to investigate how successful this was\n*   Intention-to-treat, allowing clinicians to contravene allocation on clinical grounds\n    *   Sensitivity analysis (data not presented here) investigated impact of this and found no significant effect on conclusion\n*   Considerable effort made to follow-up and detect outcome events in patients at home (leading to a rate double that of the anticipated rate)\n*   Transparent data available in detailed supplementary data\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Composite outcome \u2013 can lead to clinically less significant but common outcomes being very influential on the conclusion, whilst clinically more significant but rarer outcomes are over-looked\n    *   The secondary breakdown of events suggests this isn\u2019t the case in this trial, since all sub-groups demonstrate little difference between the groups\n*   Un-blinding of patients \u2013 the difference in practice (give blood early vs give blood later) appears to have led to un-blinding of patients\n    *   More patients in the restrictive group correctly identifying their allocation\n    *   The authors attempted to collect objective outcomes using blinded assessors, limiting the bias that could occur if patients believed they knew (and correctly knew) their allocation\n    *   The published supplementary data suggests that patients believed a liberal threshold was beneficial, thus the un-blinded restrictive-threshold patients may have biased their reporting of symptoms\n    *   It is unclear exactly what impact, if any, this had on the conclusion\n    *   It is likely that other trials have had this problem, but it has not been investigated or reported as succinctly as this trial has done so\n*   Number needed to prevent transfusion of 4 \u2013 although no clinical or financial differences were found in this trial, there are unmeasured consequences of transfusion\n    *   If all measured factors are equal, a number needed to prevent transfusion of 4 may be very relevant to individuals who wish to avoid transfusion\n*   The only statistically significant difference was death at 90 days \u2013 if all other measured outcomes are almost equal, what is causing the difference in death at 90 days?\n    *   More commonly, trials find a difference in morbidity but not in mortality, so this is an oddity\n    *   Statistically, there is ~5% chance it is a false positive\n    *   The authors suggest that the small numbers that died in this trial prevent a cause-and-effect conclusion being drawn, but that the trend is supportive of a theory that warrants further investigation\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In a group of patients with cardiovascular disease that have recently undergone cardiac surgery, a transfusion threshold of 75 g/l demonstrated no benefit over a transfusion threshold of 90 g/l\n*   There is possibly a trend towards increased morbidity, and an (unexplained) statistically significant increase in mortality from a 75 g/l transfusion threshold\n*   Global interpretation of this study is \u201cin this group of patients, a transfusion threshold of 90 g/l is most appropriate\u201d, but this RCT does not conclusively show this in my opinion\n*   It does suggest that clinicians are justified in tailoring transfusion thresholds of between 75 and 90 g/l to individual patients, as there is no definite harm and no cost difference (in the UK) from these two limits\n\n#### External Links\n\n*

Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Moderate caloric feeding with maintenance of full protein requirement, compared to standard full feeding, was not associated with reduced mortality\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Pragmatic and well designed trial\n*   Appropriate statistical plan\n*   Minimal biases present\n*   Multi-centre including different ethnic populations\n*   Highly generalisable given spread of medical, surgical and trauma patients\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Lack of blinding and clinician-led management of non-nutritional care may have introduced bias but the impact of this is unknown\n*   Primary outcome of 90-days is a long-duration compared to just 14 days of intervention, such that a direct cause-and-effect link is unlikely to be observed\n    *   However, no difference was seen in shorter secondary outcomes either\n*   Only powered to detect 8% absolute risk reduction\n    *   A smaller effect may still be clinically important\n    *   This study may have failed to show a true but small treatment effect (false negative)\n*   86% of screened patients were not randomised, which may have an impact upon the external validity (generalisability) of the results\n*   The only notable positive outcome is the reduced incidence of renal replacement therapy\n    *   As a post-hoc analysis, this should be cautiously interpret and possibly used as theory-generating for future trials\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial has not demonstrated a moderate survival benefit from permissive underfeeding with moderate caloric intake (around 50% of target calories) and maintenance of full protein requirement (1.2-1.5g per kg per day)\n*   A small survival benefit may exist but this study was not large enough to detect one\n*   Permissive underfeeding with full protein requirement appears safe in critically ill patients\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Permissive Underfeeding or Standard Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill

NEJM 2014; 371:1673-1684 doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1409860\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients, does parenteral nutrition compared with enteral nutrition improve mortality?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Open, multi-centre, parallel-group, randomised control trial\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   Patients assigned to enteral or parenteral nutrition using a telephone randomisation system in a 1:1 ratio\n    *   Allocation balanced by ICU, age, surgical status, and presence/absence of severe malnutrition\n*   90% powered to detect an absolute risk reduction in 30 day mortality of 6.4%\n    *   calculated 2400 patients required\n\n### Setting\n\n*   33 adult general ICUs in England\n*   Data collected between June 2011 and March 2014\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Adults >18 years of age; expected to require nutritional support for > 2 days, starting within 36 hours of admission\n*   Exclusion: Not suitable for either enteral or parenteral nutrition; received nutritional support in last 7 days; presence of gastrostomy/jejunostomy; pregnancy\n*   2400 adult patients with unplanned admissions to ICU\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Parenteral nutrition via a dedicated lumen of a central venous catheter\n\n### Control\n\n*   Enteral nutrition via a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube\n\nIn both groups, nutrition product used was determined by pre-existing local practice. Energy targets were 25kcal/kg/day in both groups, with the aim of reaching target within 48-72 hours. Nutrition was initiated within 36 hours of admission, and continued exclusively for 5 days unless: the patient was transitioned to exclusive oral feeding, was discharged from ICU or died\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: All-cause mortality at 30 days. No significant difference\n    *   33.1% parenteral group vs. 34.2% enteral group\n*   Secondary outcomes:\n    *   Episodes of vomiting and \u201cclinically significant\u201d hypoglycaemia were greater in the enteral feeding group. \u201cSerious\u201d hypoglycaemia was not different (0.4% vs 0.3%)\n    *   No statistical difference in the 16 other secondary outcome measures, including:\n        *   Duration of organ support\n        *   SOFA scores\n        *   Treated infectious and non-infectious complications (including aspiration events or pneumonia)\n        *   ICU and hospital length of stay\n        *   The duration of survival, and mortality at the time of discharge from the ICU, from the hospital and at 90 days\n*   Serious adverse effects were low and similar in both groups (no p values)\n    *   regurgitation or aspiration (0.2% in parenteral group vs 0.3% in enteral group)\n    *   pneumothorax (0.1% in both groups)\n\n[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5TdjFQ3ZKgo/VIQqBsWY7uI/AAAAAAAAAa0/mAiJq_jCmg4/s1600/CALORIES2.jpg)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5TdjFQ3ZKgo/VIQqBsWY7uI/AAAAAAAAAa0/mAiJq_jCmg4/s1600/CALORIES2.jpg)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Early nutritional support through the parenteral route is neither more harmful nor more beneficial than such support through the enteral route\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   High quality RCT \u2013 reported in line with CONSORT criteria\n*   Eligibility criteria defined appropriate to the population\n*   Randomisation with minimisation to control for sensible key variables\n*   Baseline characteristics were well matched with minimal exclusion criteria, meaning that results are applicable to a large percentage of the ICU population\n*   Included calories from non-nutritional sources (e.g propofol) in calculations of total calories\n*   Minimal loss to follow up\n*   Overall mortality is a feasible percentage for ICU population\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Not blinded \u2013 but this is was pragmatic trial and the primary endpoint is not subject to significant bias\n*   Crossover occurred in 6.8% in parenteral group and 3.4% in enteral group\n*   Caloric targets were not met in the majority of patients in either group, although the total caloric intake was similar (21.3 kcal/kg in parenteral group vs 18.5 kcal/kg in the enteral group). One of the potential advantages of parenteral feeding has been the effective delivery of calorific requirements particularly when early enteral feed cannot be established. If this cannot be achieved in a trial setting, then it is unlikely to be occurring in the context of our daily practice\n\nNon-protocolised selection of nutrition products, monitoring, and titration, reflecting the variety of practice at each participating site. This is not a weakness in the study design as it needed to be generalisable and applicable to the participating ICU\u2019s.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Early nutritional support through the parenteral route is neither more harmful nor more beneficial than through the enteral route. Enteral feeding does increase episodes of vomiting and hypoglycaemia but with no evidence of harm or nosocomial infection.\n*   Daily calorific targets were rarely achieved in this study (< 40% in both groups). This reflects a possible deficiency in our feeding protocols and adherence within UK and highlights the need for this to be addressed.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\] [Trial of the Route of Early Nutritional Support in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1409860)\n    \n*   \\[review\\]\u00a0T[otal parenteral nutrition vs enteral nutrition: no difference in critically ill?

Patient and their relatives were instructed not to reveal which treatment had been used. A scarf was used to cover the neck to mask cannulation status\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   This study was more about treatment in a single specialist centre with the potential for ECMO treatment versus standard based UK treatment rather than ECMO vs. conventional ventilation\n*   Only 76% in the ECMO group actually received ECMO\n*   Perhaps it would have been better if patients were randomised at the point they arrived at Glenfield. The pragmatic decision not to do this is understandable\n*   Lack of a management protocol for patients randomised to conventional ventilation. 93% in intervention group vs. 70% in control group were treated with lung protective ventilation, p<0.0001\n*   Health evaluation data representation confusing. \u00a0On first glance, 33% of patients in the ECMO group reported no problems with mobility vs. 21% of patients in the conventional ventilation group. However the data is misleading. 40 of the 90 patients in the conventional ventilation group had follow up information available = 44%. 19 had no problems with mobility. This is represented as 19 of 90 patients (21%) rather than 19 of 40 (48%). The ECMO group would be 53% (30 of 57 patients). An ARR of 5% looks less impressive than 12% particularly when up to 24% of patients in the ECMO group never received this treatment.\n*   Intention to treat analysis is useful only when there is minimal data lost to follow up. Full follow up information was only available in 58% and 36% of the patients in the ECMO group and conventional ventilation group respectively\n\n\\* Error noted in manuscript: treatment of patients receiving prone position in ECMO group. 32 of 90 patients is 36% and not 4%\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The CESAR study supports ECMO as a valid treatment option for the management of patients with severe respiratory failure. However, it does not show that ECMO is better than conventional ventilation. With incomplete follow up data in nearly half of the patients and 24% of patients in the ECMO group not actually receiving ECMO, we are left with insufficient evidence as to whether ECMO is better or worse than protocolised ARDSnet ventilation in adults patients with severe respiratory failure. The study does highlight the importance of involving specialist units, effective lung protective ventilation and ECMO as an option in refractory respiratory failure\n\n#### Links\n\nFull text only available with subscription / [abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762075)\n / doi: 10.1016/SO140-6736(09)6109-2\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Ave, CESAR, morituri te salutant!](http://ccforum.com/content/pdf/cc8946.pdf)\n     (Hail, CESAR, those who are about to die salute you!).

Critical Care 2010; 14:R1.\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In mechanically ventilated patients\u00a0without\u00a0acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress (ALI/ARDS), does lower tidal volume ventilation at 6 ml/kg (Vt-low), compared to conventional tidal volume ventilation at 10 ml/kg (Vt-high), reduce cytokine levels associated with lung injury?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial\n*   Unblinded (clinicians and researchers aware of allocation)\n*   Sealed, opaque envelopes concealed group allocation\n*   Block randomisation in sizes of 50 stratified by research site\n*   Intention-to-treat statistical analysis\n*   Interim safety analysis of secondary outcome data, by blinded independent clinicians\n*   Power calculation based upon data from similar trial in patients\u00a0with\u00a0ALI/ARDS\n    *   Expected baseline IL-6 level of 250 pg/ml\n    *   Powered to detect difference of 100 pg/ml at 80%\n    *   Two-sided significance level of 0.05\n    *   49 patients required, but quadrupled to target of 200 after best guess difference between \u201cwith ALI/ARDS\u201d and \u201cwithout ALI/ARDS\u201d populations\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Two Dutch mixed medical / surgical ICUs (one \u2018academic\u2019 and one \u2018regional teaching hospital\u2019)\n*   January 2005 to December 2007 (prior to Berlin definition of ARDS)\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: no diagnosis of ALI / ARDS; anticipated need for mechanical ventilation of more than 72 hours.\n*   Exclusion: under 18 years of age; pregnancy; uncontrolled raised intracranial pressure; COPD or restrictive lung disease; on immunosuppressive drugs (up to 100mg hydrocortisone equivalent was allowed); pulmonary embolism; previous operative lung volume reduction.\n*   347 eligible patients, 195 (56% excluded, of which: 48% met criterial, 48 refused consent, 4% clinician\u2019s discretion), 152 randomised and 150 included in analysis.\n*   Intervention group were younger and more commonly smokers. Other demographics were comparably similar:\n    *   Age: Vt-low 63 (SD\u00a0\u00b115) vs Vt-high 58 (SD\u00a0\u00b117); p=0.06\n    *   Smoker: Vt-low 76% vs Vt-high 61%; p=0.04\n    *   In both groups, around half of patients included were admitted because of \u2018cardiac arrest\u2019 or \u2018neurologic disease\u2019\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   **Vt-low**: Volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) at 6 ml/kg predicted body weight\n    *   Allowed to increase to 7 or 8 ml/kg if severe dyspnoea\n    *   Achieved 6.4 ml/kg (SD\u00a0\u00b11.0)\n    *   Mean Pmax 21.6 cmH2O (SD\u00a0\u00b17.0)\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Vt-high**: Volume-controlled ventilation at 10 ml/kg predicted body weight\n    *   Achieved 10.0 ml/kg (SD\u00a0\u00b11.0)\n    *   Mean Pmax 24.6 cm H2O (SD\u00a0\u00b16.7)\n\n#### Common management of both groups\n\n*   Trial of pressure-supported ventilation (PSV) three times daily\n    *   Continued on PSV if tolerated, at discretion of attending clinician\n    *   Pressure adjusted to meet allocated target tidal volume\n    *   If attending clinician preferred PSV over VCV, above target tidal volumes were allowed, but patient remained in allocated group for statistical analysis\n*   PEEP and FiO2 were adjusted according to local protocol (not provided)\n*   Weaning from ventilator occurred when standard parameters were met\n*   Extubation was at the attending clinician\u2019s discretion\n*   If re-intubated within 28-days, patient continued in trial in allocated group\n*   If ALI/ARDS was diagnosed, ventilation reduced to 6 ml/kg for control group in keeping with best evidence practice\n*   Alternate day bronchoscopy performed for lavage and analysis of cytokines, paired with serum analysis\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome:\n    *   **Bronchial lavage cytokines**: baseline TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were comparably similar and did not become significantly different between the two groups\n        *   Exact number not provided. Graphically represented in paper.\n    *   **Plasma cytokines**: baseline IL-6 were comparably similar, both groups decreased over time, and the Vt-low group fell statistically significantly lower\n        *   Baseline: Vt-low 51 ng/ml vs Vt-high 50 ng/ml; p=0.74\n        *   Day-4: Vt-low 11 ng/ml vs Vt-high 21 ng/ml; p=0.01\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   **Development of lung injury**\n    *   Trial was halted at interim analysis due to statistically significant difference in ALI/ARDS incidence\n        *   Vt-low n=2 (2.6%) vs Vt-high n=10 (13.5%); p=0.01\n        *   Odds ratio for developing ALI/ARDS is 5.1 for Vt-high compared with Vt-low\n*   Tertiary data:\n    *   Day-7 ventilation of survivors: Vt-low n=9 (17%) vs Vt-high n=13 (25%); p=0.31\n    *   Median 28-day ventilator-free-days: Vt-low 24 days vs Vt-high 28 days; p=0.88\n    *   28-day mortality: Vt-low n=24 (32%) vs Vt-high n=23 (31%); p=0.94\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The data suggests that mechanical ventilation with tidal volumes of 10 ml/kg is associated with sustained plasma cytokine release and contributes to development of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Given that many institutions have adopted Vt-low as a normal preventative ventilation strategy, (based on\u00a0[ARDSnet](http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/index.php?id=6495742094397224653)\n    \u00a0study and non-ARDS observational data) it is important that this clinical question is asked. This RCT is a good attempt to find supportive / refuting data.\n*   Attempt to overcome unblinded methodology by objective biochemical primary outcome\n*   Secondary outcome analysis by blinded clinicians\n*   Strict intention-to-treat analysis\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Definition of ALI/ARDS in this trial pre-dates Berlin criteria that are used now\n*   Powered for non-clinically meaningful outcome\n*   Lack of blinding and significant \u201cclinician\u2019s discretion\u201d management may have introduced bias but it is unclear the bias effect size and predominant direction of this\n*   Interim safety analysis of the secondary outcome was not initially planned and was therefore not statistically anticipated in power calculation. It was insisted upon by one of the institution\u2019s clinicians, as they suspected a significant difference between the groups. Early stopping tends to exaggerate effect, and may have led to an early false conclusion. The authors suggest that given the secondary outcome significance was p=0.01, this is unlikely (i.e. it was strongly significant difference). This is a significant weakness of the study, and some commentators have suggested it was not necessary (see links below).\n*   Only recruited in two Dutch ICUs with local (and unavailable) protocols\n*   Over 3 years, these two ICUs only identified 347 eligible patients (adults with >3 days mechanical ventilation). This appears lower than expected. No details on screening criteria (consecutive, in-hours only, etc?). How many patients weren\u2019t included that could have been? Selection bias may have been present, but the data are not presented to be certain.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This intriguing and important clinical question is not sufficiently answered by this study, but it provides a suggestion that preventative lower tidal volume ventilation is best clinical practice.\n*   Further larger trials are required if clinicians feel equipoise still exists.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Ventilation with lower tidal volumes as compared with conventional tidal volumes for patients without acute lung injury: a preventive randomized controlled trial by Determine et al](http://ccforum.com/content/14/1/R1)\n    \n*   \\[commentary\\]\u00a0[Is acute respiratory distress syndrome an iatrogenic disease? by Villar and Slutsky](http://ccforum.com/content/14/1/120)\n    \n*   \\[review\\]\u00a0[Protective mechanical ventilation in the non-injured lung: review and meta-analysis by Sutherasan et al](http://ccforum.com/content/18/2/211)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 6th March 2015  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[ARDS](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/ards/)\n[Ventilation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/ventilation/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TAME-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/blog/ebm/tame/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vent-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/the-rest-trial/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/determann/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Effort should be made to record baseline function and frailty, and further research should investigate how this aids decision making.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Important and topical clinical question\n*   Pragmatic design \u2013 authors acknowledge that the selected _longitudinal cohort_\u00a0group will have selection bias, and validated statistical methods were used to obtain an accurate estimate for the unselected _hospital cohort_\u00a0group\n*   Sensitivity analyses \u2013 suggested that the estimates obtained were robust, accurate and reliable\n*   Good external validity \u2013 included medical and surgical patients, with a range of diagnoses, co-morbidities and physiological disturbance from multiple hospitals\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Small risk of attrition bias \u2013 follow-up complete for 83% of\u00a0_longitudinal cohort_\n*   Limitations to external validity \u2013 majority were white Caucasian, and all from Canada; 12 month recovery of function is very dependent on rehabilitation and social care services, which can differ substantially between countries.\n*   Internal validity concerns \u2013 the statistics are complicated and difficult to verify; the authors reassure readers that the methods are valid and the impact of the selection bias is easily adjusted for, but the outcomes for the unselected group are still only adjusted estimates\n*   Clinical implementation \u2013 the comprehensive geriatric assessment required trained research personnel; this is not something that working clinicians can easily repeat for each patient over 80, and certainly not in an emergency to aid decisions; shorter tools need to be validated before frailty and functional assessment can be relied upon clinically\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Patients over 80 years old admitted to ICU for more than 24 hours have a poor recovery profile: 25% return to baseline after a year, 25% are alive but significantly worse than baseline and 50% are dead.\n*   These data appear reliable and generalisable to most developed healthcare systems, and this might help guide communication and decision making with patients, families and referring clinicians.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Recovery after critical illness in patients aged 80 years or older: a multi-center prospective observational cohort study](http://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-015-4028-2)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Prevalence and impact of frailty on mortality in elderly ICU patients: a prospective, multicenter, observational study by Le Maguet](http://doi.org/10.%E2%80%8B1007/%E2%80%8Bs00134-014-3253-4)\n    \u00a0and [review of this study by Portsmouth ICU Journal Club](http://www.wessexics.com/Portsmouth_ICU_Journal_Club/index.php?id=5690108795752082878)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Frailty by LITFL](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/frailty/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 18 November 2015  \nPeer-review editor: [@SteveMathieu75](http://twitter.com/SteveMathieu75)\n\n[Care of the Elderly](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/care-of-the-elderly/)\n[Frailty](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/frailty/)\n\nNo related posts found.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/heyland/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Higher\u00a0mortality rates are found only among the subset of patients who are admitted\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Large, multi-centre study\n*   Appropriate statistical analysis\n*   A priori specified subgroup analyses\n*   Risk adjustment models with high accuracy based on C statistics\n*   Very few patients excluded\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Like other papers ([Freemantle et al](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/weekend-hospitalization-and-additional-risk-of-death-an-analysis-of-inpatient-data/)\n    ) this paper cannot demonstrate\u00a0causality- it shows associations only\n*   Roughly 30% of patients were admitted, which means roughly 70% of\u00a0them were discharged. With no data on out of hospital deaths in this\u00a0study, this can be seen as 70% of patients being lost to follow up\n*   There is no mention of controlling for readmission. Were they counted as\u00a0separate attendances or as a single attendance?\n*   Risk model did not directly include level of patient sickness, relying\u00a0on parameters such as age, sex and coded diagnosis- as opposed to physiological or biochemical parameters such as would be included in APACHE II, NEWS, or SOFA\n*   ~47% of patients attending A&E had a diagnosis \u201cnot classifiable\u201d or\u00a0\u201cmissing\u201d This will introduce\u00a0bias and limit the ability of the paper to determine if there are any differences between populations\n*   A proprietary risk-adjustment model is used. While their published C-statistics are impressive, this model has only been validated by the\u00a0authors. Using an internationally validated model such as APACHE or\u00a0SOFA, or conversely making their model open-access, would be helpful in\u00a0providing external validity\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In a large population of UK patients, attending A&E at the weekend is not associated\u00a0with a significant difference in the risk adjusted 30 day in-hospital mortality compared\u00a0with attending during the week.\n*   Being admitted to hospital at the weekend is associated with an increased risk adjusted\u00a0in-hospital mortality compared with being admitted on a weekday. This association was more pronounced in patients who were admitted directly to the hospital rather than via A&E\n*   There are differences in the age, diagnoses and co-morbidities of patients who are directly admitted at the weekend compared with those who are admitted during the week. These differences are likely to result in differences in outcomes for patients admitted at the weekend vs. a weekday. It is unclear how much of the difference in outcomes reported is due to the difference in populations that present at a weekend compared with a weekday and how much is due to other factors\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Higher Mortality Rates amongst emergency patients admitted to hospital at weekends reflect a lower probability of admission](http://m.hsr.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/05/05/1355819616649630.full)\n      \n    \\[further reading\\] [Increased Mortality associated with weekend hospital admission: A case for expanded seven day services?](http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4596)\n      \n    \\[further reading\\] [Weekend specialist intensity and admission mortality in acute hospital trusts in England: A cross sectional study](http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4596)\n      \n    \\[Further Reading\\] [The Weekend Effect: Now you see it, now you don\u2019t](http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2750)\n      \n    \\[Further Reading\\] [Weekend vs Weekday transplant surgery and outcomes after kidney transplantation in the USA: A retrospective National Database analysis](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/4/e010482.full)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Segun Olusanya](https://twitter.com/iceman_ex)\n  \nSummary date: 12th May 2016  \nPeer-review editor: [Dave Slessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n and [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[mortality](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/mortality/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 2 comments\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/317b0c3c7c1e4afd783b145c8335549c?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Malcolm WG Gordon\n    \n    [22 May 2016 at 4:46 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/meacock/#comment-212)\n    \n    It doesn\u2019t surprise me that mortality rate is higher at weekends especially if not admitted via ED because most EDs have recognised the need for a consultant presence in ED at the weekend which is not true of all wards where patients are admitted to.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/meacock/?replytocom=212#respond)\n    \n*   Pingback: [LITFL Review 232 \u2013 FOAM Ed](http://www.foam-ed.com/litfl-review-232/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/meacock/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Being admitted at a weekend is associated with a significantly increased risk of death; but being an in-patient at the weekend is associated with a reduced risk of death\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Multi-centre including every NHS England trust\n*   Very large number of patients included\n*   Appropriate statistical analysis (Cox Regression Model) with attempt at controlling for known covariates\n*   Follow-up beyond hospital stay to include out-of-hospital deaths, which reduces bias\n*   Supportive analysis performed to confirm their results\n*   Included analysis of US healthcare centres as comparison\n*   Low loss to follow up\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The major weakness of this trial is that it shows association only. It cannot demonstrate a causal relationship and therefore any further interpretation is simply hypothesis generating. An important reminder that correlation should not imply causation.\n*   Absolute numbers of patients and the proportions within the subgroups (e.g emergency vs. elective) are not provided. This limits how much we can understand the results and how sure we can be about the conclusion.\n    *   Whilst some of this data is represented in histograms, the absolute numbers are currently not available \\[SM: personal communication with Professor Pagano)\\\n*   Although the Cox Model has attempted to control for 14 covariates, these are over simplified and there are many others that are intrinsically related to mortality that are not included.\\\n    \\\n    *   It is not clear how the researchers adjusted severity of illness in their analysis. The adjustment for severity of illness could also have included other prognostic scores which are associated with mortality such as [APACHE or SOFA scores](http://www.ccforum.com/content/pdf/cc8204.pdf)\\\n        , and whether the patient needed intensive care or organ support. This would allow a more robust comparison of severity of illness between patients admitted on weekdays compared to weekends.\\\n    \\\n    *   The authors suggest that the reason elective patients who are admitted on a Sunday have higher mortality rates than those admitted during the week, may be due to those patients having high risk operations on the Monday. As the Cox model could not account for these differences it suggests that the model missed a number of important aspects. Therefore, there may also be differences in baseline characteristics between emergency patients who are admitted at the weekend vs. weekday that the model did not account for; and these may be responsible for the differences in mortality found.\\\n\\\n*   The time of day that patients were admitted was not recorded. This may be more relevant than what day a patient was admitted as patients who get admitted overnight are likely to be very different to patients admitted during the day. Staffing levels are likely to be the same at 11pm on Wednesday as they are at 11pm on Sunday and therefore any differences in mortality in patients who are admitted overnight on a Sunday vs Wednesday are unlikely to be due to differences in staffing levels. Similarly, it would be useful if there was data comparing early death rate in those admitted on the weekend vs those admitted during the week.\\\n\\\n### The Bottom Line\\\n\\\n*   This study confirms an association between weekend day admissions and increased mortality within 30-days. However, in-patients are less likely to die on a weekend day than on a week day.\\\n*   The many confounding variables limit the conclusions that can be drawn and it should be considered hypothesis generating only. It is likely that differences in baseline characteristics between patients who are admitted at the weekend vs. weekday, account for at least part of the mortality difference found.\\\n*   There is no evidence presented in this study to firmly support the hypothesis that increasing senior presence and elective weekend work will reduce mortality.\\\n\\\n#### Notes\\\n\\\n*   \\* This statistic is taken from NHS Choices review (see link below). It is derived from the in-hospital 30-day mortality rate of 1.3%. This is the average mortality across all days of the week. The calculation assumes this 1.3% to be the Wednesday baseline mortality rate (which it likely approximates) and multiplies this by the 1.16 hazard ratio for Sunday admissions. This equals a mortality rate of 1.5%. Per 1000 patients, this equates to 13 deaths on Wednesdays and 15 deaths on Sundays (2 extra per 1000 patients admitted). Without the absolute mortality values, which the paper does not provide, the assumption made in this calculation cannot be cross-checked and the statistic should be used with caution.\\\n\\\n#### External Links\\\n\\\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Weekend hospitalization and additional risk of death: an analysis of inpatient data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3284293/pdf/JRSM-12-0009.pdf)\\\n    \\\n*   \\[further reading\\] [Sunday hospital admissions \u2018a bigger risk\u2019.

Intensive Care Med(2016) 42:1888-1898\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients who have undergone major abdominal surgery does the application of high flow nasal cannulae compared with standard oxygen therapy, decrease the incidence of hypoxemia at one hour after extubation?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised clinical trial\n*   Multicentre\n*   Patients were pre-consented before surgery\n*   1:1 randomisation with a computer-generated assignment sequence\n*   Stratification by study centre and the intended use of postoperative epidural analgesia\n*   Modified (excluded 8 patients: 3 had because surgery was cut short due to extensive illness and 5 who had exclusion criteria) intention to treat analysis (8 more patients added to study to achieve full sample size)\n*   Sample size calculation made assuming a 40% incidence of hypoxaemia after extubation, with a 90% power to detect a relative difference of 50% in the primary outcome between the 2 groups\n*   Unadjusted Chi squared test was used for primary outcome analysis\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Three university hospitals in France\n*   November 2013 \u2013 March 2015\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion:\u00a0All adult patients scheduled for planned or unplanned abdominal, or abdominal and thoracic surgery with an anticipated duration of 2 hours or more AND having moderate to high risk of post-operative pulmonary complications (ARISCAT risk score >26 points)\n*   Exclusion:\u00a0Life threatening condition requiring emergency surgery, OSA, Pregnancy, BMI >35\n*   220 patients\n*   Baseline characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, type of surgery, duration of surgery, pre-op risk score) were similar in both groups\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   High Flow Nasal Cannula therapy\n    *   Gas flow 50-60 L/min\n    *   Target SpO2\u00a0>95%\n\n### Control\n\n*   Usual care with standard oxygen therapy\n    *   Oxygen flow titrated to maintain SpO2\u00a0>95%\n    *   O2 delivery with continuous nasal prongs or facemask\n\n#### Both groups\n\n*   Treatment stopped on 1st post op day (between 7 \u2013 8AM)\n*   ABG on room air after 1st hour and at the end of treatment period\n*   Treatment interrupted if acute respiratory failure requiring immediate intubation or if intolerant of assigned therapy\n*   Baseline\u00a0interventions of the groups were similar (usual care vs HFNC)\n    *   Duration of intra-op ventilation 390 vs 377 minutes\n    *   Use of PEEP, recruitment manoeuvres, low tidal volume ventilation\n    *   Fluid administration (4000 vs 3250ml)\n    *   Blood transfusion (12% vs 11%)\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcomes:\n    *   The proportion of patients who developed hypoxaemia (P:F <300) 1 hour after extubation: 24% usual care (27/112) vs 21% HFNC (23/108) \u00a0 P=0.62\n    *   The proportion of patients who developed hypoxaemia (P:F <300) after discontinuation of the study treatment: 30% usual care (34/112) vs 27% HFNC (29/108) P=0.57\n*   Secondary outcomes: (usual care vs HFNC).\u00a0 No differences\n    *   Need for additional O2\u00a0at treatment end (82% vs 73%)\n    *   Pulmonary complications by day 7 (61% vs 54%)\n    *   Hypoxaemia: SpO2\u00a0< 92% on >10L/min, PaO2\u00a0<60mmHg on room air or PaO2\u00a0<80mmHg on supplemental O2\u00a0(27% vs 28%)\n    *   Need for intubation or NIV (13% vs 19%)\n    *   Unexpected ICU admission (14% vs 15%)\n    *   ICU LOS days (5 vs 6)\n    *   Hospital LOS days (11 vs 12)\n    *   In hospital mortality (3% vs 2%)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Among patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and receiving intra operative lung protective ventilation, preventive application of HFNC after extubation, compared with standard oxygen therapy, did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative hypoxaemia. The routine use of postoperative HFNC after extubation does not seem to be justified in similar patients\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Multi centre RCT\n*   Well matched treatment and control groups\n*   Primary endpoint of hypoxemia is objective but arguably this is not a clinically meaningful outcome: if the patient is dyspnoeic, needs intubation or NIV these are clinically relevant but a patient with SpO2\u00a0of 92% may be asymptomatic\n*   Allocation concealment\n*   Follow-up to hospital discharge seems complete\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Study protocol did not include standardisation for different aspects of patient care (but it\u2019s a pragmatic trial so this probably doesn\u2019t matter)\n*   Adherence to use of recruitment manoeuvres during surgery was low (but doesn\u2019t impact results as no imbalance)\n*   Short duration of HFNC post-op \u2013 was 16 hours long enough to prevent hypoxic complications, or does the risk extend longer than this?\n*   Single blinding of statisticians/coordinating centre but patients and staff members collecting data were unblinded.\n*   The post hoc analysis of the patients that received recruitment manoeuvres is difficult to interpret given the very small numbers that received these.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This is the first trial to evaluate the usefulness of preventive application of HFNC directly after extubation in abdominal surgical patients. The routine use of HFNC therapy is not warranted but it can still be used judiciously in appropropriately monitored settings with experienced staff. The utility of HFNC therapy in high risk patients and when used for longer durations need to be explored\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Effect of early postextubation high-flow nasal cannula vs conventional oxygen therapy on hypoxaemia in patients after major abdominal surgery: a French multicentre randomised controlled trial (OPERA)](http://icmjournal.esicm.org/journals/abstract.html?v=42&j=134&i=12&a=4594_10.1007_s00134-016-4594-y&doi=)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Effect of Postextubation HFNC vs Conventional O2 Therapy on Reintubation in Low-risk Patients.

This is an excellent summary of an interesting #periopmed trial.  \n    I agree that the trial was well conducted and the conclusion is probably valid and generalisable. The secondary outcomes highlight some points of interest to me\u2026 this is a group of patients with 3% mortality (arguably \u201cmoderate\u201d risk of peri-op death) but look at the incidence rate for pulmonary complications, need for intubation or NIV and unexpected ICU admissions. They\u2019re higher than we should be tolerating, and that\u2019s inside a trial. I suspect real-world data would be similar or worse. More treatment theories, hypotheses and trials are needed urgently to improve peri-operative care in these patients.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/opera/?replytocom=535#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6c15c0ade08c5e3c5afe087c13021f46?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Victor Skeppstedt\n    \n    [6 March 2017 at 6:30 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/opera/#comment-536)\n    \n    Thank you for these fine reviews on CC publications.  \n    To me, this one has a rather odd primary endpoint being \u201cincidence of hypoxemia at one hour after extubation\u201d.

It is important that similar ICU admission criteria should apply to all patients across all jurisdictions, and equally to patients with pandemic illness and those with other conditions\n*   The **Ontario Health Plan** **for an Influenza pandemic (OHPIP)** is a triage protocol which was developed following the SARS outbreak [Ontario protocol (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1635763/)\n    \n*   The **New South Wales (NSW) triage protocol** was developed following the H1N1 pandemic in 2008\n*   Both protocols employed a combination of **exclusion criteria** and **SOFA scores** to determine ICU admission priority\n\n### Design\n\n*   A prospective evaluation study\n*   **Simulated pandemic model**, where usual care, non-pandemic patients were evaluated by an ICU doctor using both the NSW and OHPIP triage protocols, to determine whether they would have qualified for admission to the ICU during a pandemic crisis\n*   Patients were assessed at admission and at 12 and 72 hours in the case of the **NSW protocol**; they were assessed at admission and 48 and 120 hours with the **Ontario protocol**\n*   The **primary outcome measure** was **increase in ICU bed availability**, defined as the percentage of the total bed-days spent by patients in the ICU after the triage protocols had theoretically excluded them from admission or discharged them from the ICU\n*   **Increase in ICU bed availability** was calculated as a percentage of the mean number of beds available per ICU per day\n*   Bed availability results were compared using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test\n\n### Setting\n\n*   8 adult, tertiary referral Intensive Care Units in **New South Wales and Queensland**, **Australia** in the period after the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic\n*   September 2009 to May 2010\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**: All ICU patients were screened\n*   **Exclusion**: Patients having elective surgery\n*   1262 patients screened; 457 (36.2%) elective surgery patients were excluded\n*   **805 patients** (63.8%) were evaluated using the NSW and OHPIP triage protocols\n*   135 ICU beds were available for use\n*   **Mean age** of patients was 60.4 (SD 19.4), with a mean APACHE II score of 18 (SD 8)\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Application of the **NSW triage protocol** at ICU admission\n*   Patients were re-evaluated using the NSW protocol at **12 and 72 hours** to assess whether they should be discharged from ICU\n*   The NSW triage protocol has three tiers and these are designed to be activated in a stepwise, time-based fashion as demand for critical care services increases\n\n**Tier 1:**\n\n1\\. **Respiratory failure requiring intubation** with persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for adults) unresponsive to fluid therapy after 6\u201312 hours and signs of additional end-organ dysfunction (eg, oliguria, decreased mental status, cardiac ischaemia)  \n2\\. **Failure to respond** to mechanical ventilation (no improvement in oxygenation or lung compliance) and antibiotics after 72 hours of treatment for a bacterial pathogen  \n3\\.

No organ failure: **Defer or discharge** from ICU\n\n### Management common to both groups\n\n*   ICU admission and management were **not altered** by the study as this was a simulated model\n*   Both protocols employed the following prioritisation criteria, for patients who did not meet the exclusion criteria outlined above:\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-19-at-4.30.01-pm-300x110.png)\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**:\n*   Using the **NSW triage protocol** at admission, the increases in ICU bed availability using Tiers 1, 2 and 3 were 3.5%, 14.7% and 22.7%, respectively (p<0.001)\n*   The incremental increases in ICU bed availability at **12 hours after admission** using Tiers 1, 2 and 3 were 19.2%, 16.1% and 14.1%, respectively (p<0.001)\n*   At **72 hours**, there were further non-significant incremental increases in ICU bed availability of 0.9% (p = 0.42), 0.8% (p = 0.33) and 0.7% (P = 0.26)\n*   **Secondary outcome**:\n*   Using the **OHPIP at admission**, the increase in ICU bed availability was 52.8%\n*   This represented a **significant difference** from all tiers of the NSW protocol (p<0.0001)\n*   Using the protocol at **48 hours and 120 hours** provided increased supplemental bed availability of 6.7% and 5.4% respectively\n*   A 17-bed general ICU would expect to make up to four beds available by using the NSW protocol at admission, depending on which tier was used, and about nine beds using the OHPIP protocol at admission\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   When tested in a non-influenza pandemic setting, both the NSW and OHPIP triage protocols **provided increases in ICU bed availability**, but the OHPIP protocol provided the greatest increase overall. Using the NSW triage protocol, ICU bed availability increased as the protocol was escalated\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   This study addressed an area that has had limited investigation to date\n*   The results were consistent with a previous retrospective study\n*   It gives some information on the potential impact of objective triage criteria and how this is likely to impact on available resources. As such, it is useful for pandemic planning\n*   The patient cohort was a representative sample of ICU patients with a wide range of presentations\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   This data has limited external validity beyond the Australasian setting as ICU admission and discharge practices will vary worldwide\n*   The simulation does not account for the **human factors** and **difficult ethical dilemmas** involved in restricting ICU admission during a crisis\n*   The definition of severe trauma varies by jurisdiction\n*   The **seniority of clinician** performing the triage assessment was not uniform. Ideally, the triaging of ICU patients in this context would be performed by two ICU specialists\n*   There is the potential for significant **inter-operator variability**, even with an apparently objective scoring system\n*   The implementation of a triage protocol will likely have come as part of a **phased response**. As a result, ICU admission behaviours will likely have deviated from normal practice in the period prior to the activation of a triage protocol. A study of the utility of a triage protocol in the midst of a real pandemic situation would have had more validity\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Decisions regarding the most appropriate use of resources are something that intensive care specialists confront every day\n*   The application of an ICU triage protocol has the potential to significantly reduce ICU admissions during overwhelming demand from a viral pandemic\n*   The decision on when to activate such a protocol is ethically complex and the implementation should apply to all patients, across all jurisdictions\n*   I hope that I am not in a situation where I have to implement a triage protocol, but the Ontario model seems to be the most effective in creating additional bed capacity in the Australian setting\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Original Paper](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/development-and-evaluation-of-an-influenza-pandemic-intensive-car)\n    \n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Allocating ventilators in a pandemic](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689?query=RP)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Cross-sectional survey on use of triage protocols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28866976)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ANZICS COVID-19 guidelines](https://www.anzics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ANZICS-COVID-19-Guidelines-Version-1.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Mauricio Cecconi COVID-19 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKS1pahoPRU)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[NSW Influenza Pandemic Guidelines (2009)](https://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2010_028.pdf)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Fraser Magee](https://twitter.com/Fraz65)\n  \nSummary date: 18/03/2020  \nPeer-review editor: [Segun Olusanya](https://twitter.com/iceman_ex)\n\n[COVID-19](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/covid-19/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Microbiology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/microbiology/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1057425e3642d603ee689d6655d1630e?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Simon\n    \n    [9 September 2020 at 7:34 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/pandemic-triage/#comment-13606)\n    \n    Our hospital deployed the Ontario triage tool during March/April, though we never really bothered with SOFA scores.

At 28 days, a\u00a0restrictive transfusion strategy was found to be non-inferior to a liberal transfusion strategy in cardiac surgery patients with a moderate-to-high risk of death with regards to a composite outcome of death and major disability\n*   This is the follow up data at 6 months\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n*   1:1 ratio of restrictive vs liberal strategy\n*   Allocation concealment (central web-based allocation)\n*   Permuted blocks of varying size, stratified to centre\n*   Unblinded, although the outcomes were evaluated by those unaware of the trial-group assignment\n*   A modified intention-to-treat analysis was also conducted\n*   Power calculation: The event rate of the primary composite outcome was assumed to be 10%. Partway through the trial, the power of the trial was increased from 85% to 90%, which required a sample size of 5000 patients. The aim was to detect non-inferiority at a one-sided alpha of 0.025, with a non-inferiority margin of 3%\n\n### Setting\n\n*   19 countries, 74 sites\n*   Randomisation from January 20th 2014 to March 20th 2017\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: patients 18 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery with a pre-operative EuroSCORE I of 6 or higher (the EuroSCORE I is a validated scoring system that is predictive of in-hospital mortality)\n*   Exclusion\n    *   unable to receive or declined blood products\n    *   pre-operative autologous donation program\n    *   heart transplant surgery\n    *   surgery for ventricular assist device\n    *   pregnant or lactating\n*   5243 randomised; 5092 of these patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 4860 (2430 in each treatment group) were included in the primary per-protocol analysis\n    *   Six-month follow-up data on the primary outcome were available for 96% of the patients\n    *   Baseline demographics similar in both groups\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Patients in the restrictive group received a red-cell transfusion if the haemoglobin concentration was less than 7.5g/dL intra-operatively or post-operatively\n\n### Control\n\n*   Patients in the liberal group received a red-cell transfusion if the haemoglobin concentration was less than 9.5g/dL intra-operatively or post-operatively or less than 8.5g/dL in the non-ICU ward\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Haemoglobin level was measured pre-operatively, intra-operatively and post-operatively at specified intervals. If the haemoglobin fell below the threshold, 1 unit of red cells was administered followed by reassessment of the level\n*   All other aspects of care were directed by the treating medical teams\n*   The treating physicians followed the transfusion protocol until 28 days after surgery or hospital discharge, whichever came first\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome:**\u00a0A restrictive transfusion threshold was non-inferior to the liberal transfusion group for a composite outcome of\u00a0death from any cause, myocardial infarction, new focal neurologic deficit (stroke), or new-onset renal failure with dialysis occurring within 6 months after the index surgery:\n    *   Restrictive-threshold group: 402 of 2317 patients (17.4%)\n    *   Liberal-threshold group: 402 of 2347 patients (17.1%)\n    *   Absolute risk difference: 0.22% (95% CI -1.95% to 2.39%; P=0.006 for non-inferiority)\n    *   Odds Ratio: 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.18)\n*   Secondary outcome (restrictive vs liberal threshold group) occurring within 6 months after the index surgery:\n    *   Death from any cause: 6.2% vs 6.4%\n        *   Odds ratio: 0.95 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.21)\n    *   Myocardial infarction: 7.3% vs 7.3%\n        *   Odds ratio: 0.99 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.24)\n    *   Stroke: 4% vs 3.3%\n        *   Odds ratio: 1.21 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.66)\n    *   New onset renal failure with dialysis: 3.9% vs 4.2%\n        *   Odds ratio: 0.93 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.25)\n    *   Expanded secondary composite outcome\n        *   All the components of the primary outcome as well as emergency department visit, hospital readmission, or coronary revascularization occurring within 6 months after the index surgery)\n            *   43.8% vs 42.8%\n            *   Odds ratio: 1.04 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.17)\n        *   Coronary revascularisation: 0.7% vs 0.9%\n        *   Hospital readmission or emergency department visit: 35.5% vs 33.6%\n        *   Hospital readmission: 26.2% vs 23.6%\n        *   Number of hospital readmissions per patient: 0.38\u00b10.76 vs\u00a00.34\u00b10.74\n        *   Emergency department visit: 26.3% vs 25.4%\n        *   Number of emergency department visits per patient:\u00a00.44\u00b11.18 vs\u00a00.40\u00b10.95\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In patients undergoing cardiac surgery who were at moderate-to-high risk for death, a restrictive strategy for red-cell transfusion was noninferior to a liberal strategy with respect to the composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis at 6 months after surgery\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Multi-centre design improves generalisability\n*   Concealled allocation via web interface prevents selection bias\n*   Objective outcomes reduces bias that may occur due to the open-label (unblinded) design\n*   Patients were randomised before surgery meaning that the effect of two transfusion strategies was examined for the whole of their journey as a cardiac surgery patient\n*   The sample population were a sick group of cardiac surgery patients, so treatment effect, if any would likely be more obvious than low-risk cardiac surgery patients\n*   Appropriate analysis \u2018per-protocol\u2019 (compared to the more common \u2018intention-to-treat\u2019) as this was a non-inferiority design\n    *   Per-protocol statistical analysis will tend to exaggerate any difference between groups\n    *   If no difference is found it strengthens the non-inferiority conclusion\n*   This is the largest study with the longest follow up for the long-term outcomes of peri-operative transfusion strategies\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Physicians were not required to follow the transfusion protocol after day 28 or hospital discharge and it is therefore not possible to determine the degree to which the differences in haemoglobin concentrations or transfusions continued thereafter\n*   Outcome data were obtained from a variety of sources, including telephone contact, hospital records, and database registries. It is possible that some follow-up visits were missed, although there is no reason to believe that missed visits would be more frequent in one treatment group than in the other\n*   Determination of cause of death was not possible\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients who had a moderate\u00a0to high risk of death after cardiac surgery, a restrictive strategy of red cell transfusion was non-inferior to a liberal strategy in terms of the pre-specified primary composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or renal failure with dialysis\n*   This follow up data shows that at 6 months, a restrictive transfusion strategy is still non-inferior to a liberal strategy\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Six-Month Outcomes after Restrictive or Liberal Transfusion for Cardiac Surgery](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808561)\n    .

left pericardiotomy for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery\n=============================================================================================\n\nMario Gaudino, The Lancet Dec 4 2021; 398: 2075\u201383 https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02490-9\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In selected patients undergoing cardiac surgery, does posterior left pericardiotomy compared with usual care, reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Atrial fibrillation is common following cardiac surgery with approximately one-third of patients developing new atrial fibrillation in the immediate postoperative period\n*   Pericardial effusion is common following cardiac surgery with approximately two-thirds of patients having evidence of effusion on echocardiography\n*   Pericardial effusion can cause inflammatory changes in the myocardium which can result in atrial arrhythmias\n*   Posterior left pericardiotomy allows drainage of the pericardial space into the left pleural space, reducing postoperative pericardial effusions\n*   Previous small studies, with poor and inconsistent methodology, have suggested pericardiotomy reduces the incidence of atrial fibrillation\n*   This trial aimed to provide quality evidence to guide operative management in these at risk patients\n\n### Design\n\n*   Single centre, RCT\n*   1:1 randomisation stratified by CHA2DS2\\-VASc score\u00a0\n*   Variable block randomisation with computer generated allocation to group\n*   Blinding of patient and assessor\n*   Surgical team were made aware of the allocation the night prior to surgery\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   A priori publication of study protocol\n*   Logistic regression analysis took into account the operating surgeon and other variables such as age, sex, diabetes, LVEF, extent of coronary disease, chronic lung disease, perioperative beta-blocker use\n*   Sample size of 350 patients initially calculated to provide 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in primary outcome, based on previous literature and accounting for protocol violations/study dropout (presuming primary outcome incidence of 30%)\n*   Sample size increased to 420 after second interim analysis, due to lower than anticipated incidence in primary outcome\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Patients treated at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, NY, USA\n*   Trial recruitment September 2017 to August 2021\n*   Protocol amendment in March 2020 to allow recruitment during COVID-19 pandemic\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**:\n    *   Adults undergoing cardiac surgery\n    *   Cardiac surgery included coronary surgery, aortic valve surgery or aortic surgery (or a combination of these)\n*   **Exclusion**:\n    *   Previous history of atrial fibrillation or arrhythmias\n    *   Patients having mitral or tricuspid valve surgery\n    *   Patients with disease of the left pleura precluding the intervention\n    *   Repeat sternotomies or minimally invasive procedures\n*   3601 patients were screened and 420 included\n*   212 were assigned to the left posterior pericardiotomy group and 208 to the no intervention group\n*   Median age was 61 years\n*   76% were male\n*   There was good baseline balance between groups\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   A 4-5 cm vertical incision posterior to the phrenic nerve and extending from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the diaphragm\n*   212 patients\n*   3 patients in this group did not receive the intervention\n\n### Control\n\n*   No intervention\n*   208 patients\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for the entire postoperative in-hospital stay.\n*   Daily ECG\n*   In person or telephone interview at day 30 post discharge\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: the occurrence of in-hospital postoperative atrial fibrillation during the entire in-hospital stay (defined as AF for more than 30 seconds on monitor)\n    *   Intervention vs Control:Intention to treat analysis, post-operative atrial fibrillation significantly less in the intervention group 17% vs 32% (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.70, p=0.0005)\n*   **Secondary outcomes**: Intervention vs Control\n    *   Time spent in atrial fibrillation 1262 hours vs 2277 hours\n    *   Need for anti-arrhythmic medications 17% vs 31%\n    *   Need for anticoagulation 6% vs 14%\n    *   Duration of post-operative in-hospital stay 5 vs 5 days\n    *   When limiting the analysis to patients who had received perioperative beta-blockers (92% of total) there was still a difference between groups, with 11% vs 26% having atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Safety Outcomes:** Intervention vs Control\n    *   Post-operative mortality 2 vs 1 patients\n    *   Pericardial effusion (as assessed on echocardiography) significantly less in intervention group: 12% vs 21% (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91)\n    *   Postoperative major events, eg stroke, myocardial infarct 3% vs 2%\n    *   Left pleural effusion 30% vs 32%\n    *   Surgery time: 306 vs 289 minutes\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Performing left posterior pericardiotomy at the time of cardiac surgery significantly reduces the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation\n*   The intervention appears safe without adverse effects\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   An important question with a clinically meaningful outcome\n*   Allocation concealment, intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up\n*   Exclusion of patients having mitral and tricuspid valve surgery as the pathogenesis of AF in these patients is less likely due to pericardial effusion and inflammation.\n*   The intervention is low cost and adds very little extra time to surgery\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Single centre study: tend to provide larger treatment effects than multicentre trials\n*   There is no information as to whether this intervention is superior to other preventative methods for AF, eg colchicine.\n*   A small study likely underpowered to detect differences in hospital length of stay, mortality and other rare events\n*   A large bias towards white males (>70%)\n*   Nearly 80% of the operations were performed by a single surgeon, significantly limiting external validity\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This simple intervention seems to be a safe surgical technique to reduce post-cardiac surgery

JAMA\u00a02016; 315(13): 1345-1353. doi:10.1001/jama.2016.2706\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients who develop acute\u00a0hypoxaemic respiratory failure after abdominal surgery, does non-invasive ventilation compared to standard oxygen therapy prevent the need for re-intubation?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Open-label, randomised, controlled trial\n*   Design approved and registered in advance: [clinicaltrials.gov Id: NCT01971892](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01971892)\n    \u00a0\n*   Computer generated randomisation and concealed allocation sequence\n    *   Stratified by study site, age (above or below 60 years), site of surgery (upper vs lower abdomen), use of post-operative epidural analgesia\n*   Interim blinded reviews at \u2153 and \u2154 recruitment points\n*   90% Power to demonstrate superiority of\u00a0non-invasive ventilation (NIV) against standard oxygen therapy (StdO2) if 300 patients recruited, based upon the following estimates from expert opinion:\n    *   65% re-intubation rate in StdO2 group\n    *   40% re-intubation rate in NIV group (i.e. absolute risk reduction of 25%)\n    *   15% drop out or loss to follow-up\n\n### Setting\n\n*   20 Intensive Care Units in France\n*   May 2013 to September 2014\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion:\u00a0Adult patients (>18 years) who had undergone laparoscopic or non-laparoscopic elective or non-elective abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia who develop\u2026\n    *   Acute respiratory failure within 7 days of surgery defined as _presence of both_\n        *   **Hypoxaemia for\u00a0> 30 minutes** (PaO2 < 8 kPa breathing air OR\u00a0< 10.6 kPa on 15 l/min O2 OR peripheral SpO2 \u2264 90% breathing air)\n        *   **Clinical features of respiratory distress** (respiratory rate > 30 /min OR intense respiratory muscle work)\n*   Exclusion:\u00a0Limits to life-sustaining treatment; contraindications to NIV; sleep apnoea syndrome; need for immediate re-intubation; need for immediate surgical procedure; previous recruitment in research trial\n*   535 screened, 300 randomised, 293 included in primary outcome analysis (2.3% loss to follow-up)\n*   The groups\u00a0had similar\u00a0baseline characteristics (NIV vs StdO2):\n    *   Age 64.4 vs 62.5\n    *   BMI 27.1 vs 27.2\n    *   SOFA score 4.5 vs 4.3\n    *   Respiratory rate 28.8 vs 28.2\n    *   Laparoscopic approach 11.1% vs 11.0%\n    *   Epidural analgesia 14.5% vs 15.5%\n    *   Extubated within 6 hours of primary surgery 62.1% vs 63.5%\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)\n    *   Used from randomisation until day 30 or ICU discharge\n    *   Applied via face-mask using an ICU or NIV-dedicated ventilator with an HME or active humidification\n    *   Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) started at 5 cmH2O and increased to 15 cmH2O as needed targeting tidal volume (Vt) 6\u20138 ml/kg predicted body weight\n    *   Positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP, or EPAP) started at 5 cmH2O and increased to 10 cmH2O as needed\n        *   PEEP and inspiratory fraction of oxygen (FiO2) were titrated to maintain SpO2 > 94%\n    *   \u201cEncouraged\u201d to use this for at least 6 hours a day, either continuously or intermittently\n    *   Standard O2 delivered between NIV treatments\n    *   Observed treatment of this group:\n        *   Mean IPAP: 6.7 cmH2O\n        *   Mean PEEP: 5.4 cmH2O\n        *   Mean FiO2: 50%\n        *   Mean Vt: 8.3 ml/kg\n        *   Mean duration of NIV during first day:\u00a07.4 hours\n        *   Proportion given at least 6 hours as intended in first day: 68.9%\n        *   Median total duration of NIV: 4 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   Standard oxygen therapy (StdO2)\n    *   Supplemental O2\u00a0up to 15 l/min to maintain SpO2 > 94%\n    *   Observed treatment of this group:\n        *   10.4 l/min O2\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   High-flow oxygen via nasal cannulae were not permitted in either group\n*   Management and treatment was at the treating clinician\u2019s discretion\n*   Criteria for re-intubation defined as objectively as possible\n    *   respiratory or cardiac arrest\n    *   respiratory pauses with loss of consciousness or gasping\n    *   massive aspiration\n    *   inability to clear secretions\n    *   heart rate less than 50 ppm with reduced consciousness\n    *   severe haemodynamic instability unresponsive to fluid or vasopressors\n    *   return to theatre (this category was removed for modified intention to treat analysis)\n*   Invasive ventilation management was a low-tidal volume lung protective strategy\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome:\u00a0The incidence of re-intubation within 7 days of surgery was lower in the NIV group compared to the StdO2 group\n    *   NIV group 33.1% vs StdO2 group 45.5% (ARR 12.4%; 95% CI\u00a01.3% to 23.5%; P=0.03)\n        *   This remained statistically significant in the modified Intention to Treat (mITT) analysis, with the 32 patients re-intubated for surgery removed (representing 11% of patients)\n    *   Number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one re-intubation: 9 patients\n    *   [Fragility Index](http://fragilityindex.com)\n        : 2\n*   Secondary outcome: see table for data\n    *   Re-intubation rate within 30 days was not different\n    *   Incidence of pneumonia and health-care associated infections was lower in the NIV group\n    *   Days alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation were greater in the NIV group\n    *   The 30-day mortality ARR point estimate was 5.04%, which gives an NNT of 20 patients, but this was not statistically significant and the 95% confidence intervals of the ARR include -2.5% to 12.8% (slightly harmful to very beneficial)\n    *   There was no difference in the report of adverse events or intolerance to therapy\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nivas-data-table.png)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In patients with established hypoxaemic respiratory failure after abdominal surgery, non-invasive ventilation reduces the risk of re-intubation within 7 days compared to standard oxygen therapy.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Well designed and conducted trial with clear manuscript\n*   Appropriate methodology for clinical question\n*   Good\u00a0internal validity of results however see point about Fragility in weakness section\n    *   Good randomisation and allocation strategy to minimise bias\n    *   Appropriate effort to make outcome objective given it is not possible to blind treating clinicians or patients to allocation\n    *   Small loss-to-follow up relative to primary outcome incidence, and intention-to-treat analysis to minimise bias\n    *   Appropriate statistical methods\n*   Good external validity (generalisability)\n    *   Multi-centre trial design\n    *   Explicit patient group \u2013 high-risk patients having undergone major-complex abdominal surgery\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Observed rate of re-intubation was lower than expected, so some secondary outcomes that did not demonstrate statistical significance may be Type 2 errors due to the trial being underpowered (this is not relevant to the primary outcome since significance was demonstrated)\n    *   This is particularly relevant to mortality, which would have been a more meaningful outcome to patients and clinicians\n*   Despite attempts to define an objective primary end-point, bias from unblinded clinicians may have contributed to the significant difference favouring NIV\n*   The low Fragility Index of 2 highlights how this is not robust evidence \u2013 given 7 patients were lost to follow-up and the potential clinician bias in the primary outcome,\u00a0this is a significant weakness\n*   Generalising\u00a0to all\u00a0health-care systems and patients may not be possible as there was a heavy weighting towards laparotomy (91%) vs laparoscopic (11%) surgery (other surgical factors were reasonably well balanced)\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In this trial, 6 hours of low-level non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure after major abdominal surgery reduced the need for re-intubation compared to standard oxygen therapy\n*   Although the significant result is relatively fragile, no clinically relevant\u00a0harm or intolerance was identified and therefore this paper will change my practice\n*   Further studies comparing this strategy to high-flow nasal oxygen therapy are urgently needed\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Effect of Noninvasive Ventilation on Tracheal Reintubation Among Patients With

The bolus of heparin was not given if the patient had a) already received one b) received therapeutic LMWH (heparin infusion also delayed until 12 hours after last injection) or c) fondaparinux (heparin infusion also delayed until 24 hours after the last injection).

An appropriately powered study which determines mortality or morbidity (chronic pulmonary hypertension) is what is needed.\n*   Haemodynamic decompensation or collapse was recorded in 26 (2.58%) of the 1005 patients. Only 17 (1.58%) of the 1005 patients required catecholamine support. Whilst this reached statisitical significance, it is questionable as to how clinically relevant \u2018haemodynamic decompensation\u2019 is as an outcome when a) over a 1/3 of these patients did not require catecholamines at any point during the 7 days post randomisation b) the incidence is so low in both groups (albeit higher in the placebo arm) c) there was no apparent difference in mortality d) evidence of persistent organ dysfunction or time to resolution was not recorded\n*   Not powered to determine mortality benefit\n*   The inclusion criteria of up to 15 days for randomisation is long and perhaps the risk of using tenecteplase would outweigh any potential benefits at this stage\n*   There was a higher rate of pre-randomisation use of LMWH/fondaparinux in the tenectaplase group\n\n_Boehringer helped fund trial. However, they had no role in the design, conduct, analysis or reporting of the trial_\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients with sub-massive PE, the administration of a bolus of tenecteplase results in only a modest haemodynamic benefit and no reduction in 30 day mortality. Furthermore, it\u2019s use is associated with a 10-fold increase in intracranial haemorrhage (2% vs. 0.2%) and a 5-fold increase in major haemorrhage (6.3% vs. 1.2%). This study does not support the use of thrombolysis in submassive PE.\n\n#### Links\n\n[abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1302097)\n\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1302097\n\n#### MayEditorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Life in the fast lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/thrombolysis-submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n*   [Academic life in EM](http://www.academiclifeinem.com/peitho-fibrinolysis-intermediate-risk-pulmonary-embolism/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\nSummary date: 21 June 2014\n\nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/pulmonary-embolism/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/peg-ed/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ivc-filters/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/optalyse-pe/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/peitho/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

NEJM. March 19 2017. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1616218\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u226435%, undergoing cardiac surgery, does levosimenden compared with placebo reduce the incidence of a composite outcome of:\n    *   death at day 30\n    *   renal replacement therapy (RRT) at day 30\n    *   perioperative myocardial infarct at day 5\n    *   use of mechanical assist device at day 5\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo control\n*   1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan or placebo. Web-based allocation\n*   Placebo infusion appeared identical to levosimendan\n*   The primary end point was determined on the modified intention to treat group and adjusted for trial group, surgery type, LVEF, age and sex\n*   There was missing data for 7 patients in the levosimendan group and 11 patients in the placebo group and these were analysed as not having had an event\n*   Sample size was based on an assumed event rate of the four-component end point of 32% in the placebo group, a 35% lower risk with levosimendan than with placebo and a significance level of 0.01. A sample size of 760 patients was calculated to provide 80% power\n\n### Setting\n\n*   70 sites in the US and Canada\n*   September 2014 \u2013 November 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: all patients \u226518 years, undergoing cardiac surgery (on bypass) with LVEF \u226435%. The surgery could be coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), CABG + aortic-valve surgery, isolated mitral-valve surgery or any combination of these\n*   Exclusion criteria included:\n    *   Restrictive/obstructive cardiomyopathy, constrictive/restrictive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade\n    *   Systemic infection\n    *   Dialysis at randomization\n    *   eGFR < 30\n    *   Weight > 170kg\n    *   Heart Rate > 120bpm for >10minutes\n    *   Haemoglobin < 80g/L\n    *   Serum potassium <3.5mmol/L or >5.5mmol/L\n    *   History of Torsades de Pointes\n    *   Mechanical assist device placed pre-surgery\n    *   Patients with femoral occlusive disease\n    *   Liver dysfunction (Child Pugh Class B or C)\n    *   Immune compromise, pregnancy\n*   882 people randomized. 442 assigned to receive levosimendan (intention to treat population)\u00a0with 428 actually receiving it (modified ITT). 440 assigned to receive placebo (ITT population) with 421 actually receiving it (modified ITT)\n*   Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups with the authors noting many had multiple co-morbidities and median LVEF 27%. Isolated CABG accounted for 2/3rds of the surgical cases\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Levosimendan was commenced just before surgery, after the arterial line was inserted and before knife to skin. The starting dose was 0.2ug/kg/min for 1 hour then 0.1ug/kg/min for 23 hours.\n\n### Control\n\n*   A placebo (indistinguishable from the levosimendan) was run at\u00a0the same\u00a0rate for the same duration\n\n#### In Both Groups\n\n*   Use of other medications including vasopressors and other inotropes, was left to the treating team to prescribe as indicated\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: No statistical difference in either 4 point and 2 point composite endpoints\n    *   4 point composite endpoint:\n        *   death at day 30, RRT at day 30, perioperative myocardial infarct at day 5 (CKMB > 100ng/ml or 10x upper limit of normal),\u00a0OR use of a mechanical assist device (IABP, ECMO, VAD)\n        *   24.5% (105 patients) in the levosimendan group and 24.5% (103 patients) in the placebo group (adjusted OR 1.0, 99% CI 0.66-1.54; P=0.98)\n    *   2 point composite endpoint:\n        *   death at day 30 or use of a mechanical assist device\n        *   13.1% (56 patients) in levosimendan group and 11.4% (48 patients) in the placebo group (adjusted OR 1.18, 96% CI 0.76-1.82; P=0.45)\n*   Secondary Outcomes:\n    *   No statistical difference in ICU length of stay; rehospitalisation at 30 days; death at 90 days; any adverse events\n    *   Fewer \u00a0patients in the\u00a0levosimendan group had a low cardiac output state (18.2% vs 25.7%) and the need for other inotropes beyond 24 hours after the initiation of the infusion (54.9% vs 62.7%)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Prophylactic levosimendan compared to placebo, in patients with reduced LVEF undergoing cardiac surgery on bypass, did not result in a lower rate of the composite endpoint of death, renal replacement therapy, infarct\u00a0OR need for a mechanical cardiac assist device\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Robust design with adherence to all the principles needed to ensure good internal and external validity: modified intention to treat analysis, allocation concealment, blinding and near complete follow-up\n*   The composite outcome is clinically relevant\n*   The sample size was increased part way through the trial when the composite event rate among the first 600 patients was found to be lower than originally anticipated.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The dose of levosimendan (particularly the loading dose) may not have been high enough to make a difference in these groups\n*   There may be groups not identified in this study that may benefit from levosimendan, for example ultra-low ejection fraction patients\n*   The composite end point reduces the usefulness of the results but 3000 patients would be needed to assess a mortality difference\n*   This article did not outline a cost comparison. Levosimendan is expensive and with no statistical difference in outcomes, this needs to be considered\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Levosimendan does not have any clinical outcome benefit, when used as a prophylactic agent, in patients with\u00a0poor left ventricular ejection fraction undergoing cardiac surgery on bypass\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Levosimendan in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction Undergoing Cardiac Surgery](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1616218)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Levosimendan for Hemodynamic Support after Cardiac Surgery](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1616325)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[LEOPARDS Trial; The Bottom Line review of Levosimendan in Septic Shock](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/leopards/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Effects of Levosimendan on Patients with Heart Failure Complicating Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28597399)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[Celia Bradford](https://twitter.com/celiabradford)\n  \nSummary date:\u00a0March 23 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Cardiac Surgery](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiac-surgery/)\n[Cardiology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiology/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Inotropes](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/inotropes/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 2 comments\n\n*   Pingback: [CHEETAH \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/cheetah/)\n    \n*   Pingback: [LITFL Review 276 \u2022 LITFL \u2022 Life in the Fast Lane Medical Blog](https://lifeinthefastlane.com/litfl-review-276/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/levo-cts/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

I have never used nebulised MgSO4 to treat asthma in adults and this won\u2019t change. The use of intravenous MgSO4 in severe acute asthmatics is not without its side effects but I would still continue to use it in patients with life-threatening asthma. My expectation of achieving any significant clinical impact by giving 2g magnesium will remain low\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[original article full text\\]: [Intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate versus standard therapy for severe acute asthma (3Mg trial) by Goodacre](http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213260013700705.pdf?id=baajgJLCwKZrIc0XreaDu)\n    \n*   \\[podcast\\]: [Magnesium in acute severe asthma; 3Mg trial.](http://www.heftemcast.co.uk/magnesium-in-acute-severe-asthma-3mg-trial/)\n     HEFT EMCAST\n*   \\[Further reading\\]: [BTS/SIGN Guidelines on management of asthma 2012](https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/clinical-information/asthma/btssign-guideline-on-the-management-of-asthma/)\n    \u00a0(NB study used 2007 guidelines)\n*   \\[Further reading\\]: [Economic evaluation of 3Mg trial](http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/116232/FullReport-hta18220.pdf)\n     \u2013 Health Technology Assessment 2014\n*   \\[Further reading\\]: [Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department.

With relatively small numbers of patients included there is a greater probability of random differences in baseline cognitive function between the treatment groups\n*   RBMT test may be insensitive for very mild impairment. The authors stated that the updated RBMT-3 version was not available when this study commenced\n*   FAB has not been validated in an OOH cardiac arrest population\n*   Proportionately fewer TTM patients with poor neurological recovery (cerebral performance category 3 or 4) were followed-up than those with good recovery. This will bias toward less cognitive impairment in the OHCA group compared to the STEMI-control group, but should still allow accurate comparison between 33\u00baC and 36\u00baC. It will under-estimate cognitive impairment from cardiac arrest.

This was administered subcutaneously prior to the tenecteplase or placebo.\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome:\n    *   composite adverse outcome\n        *   within 5 days \u2013 PE related or treatment related\n            *   PE related\n                *   death\n                *   hypotension requiring vasopressor infusion\n                *   intubation\n            *   Treatment related\n                *   death from haemorrhage\n                *   major bleeding (intracranial or intraspinal haemorrhage, active bleeding with >2g/dL drop in haemoglobin within 24hrs requiring transfusion; bleeding that required surgery, endoscopic or intravascular treatment)\n        *   within 90 days\n            *   recurrent PE\n            *   poor functional capacity\n                *   Right ventricular hypokinesis or dilatation or RV systolic pressure >45mmHg\n                *   Exercise intolerance or dyspnoea at rest\n                    *   inability to walk 330m using 6 minute walk test\n                    *   severe dyspnoea defined by NYHA functional class 3/4, assessed by questionnaire\n            *   Poor physical \u00a0health related quality of life outcome\n                *   SF36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score <30\n                *   VEINES QOL survey <40 (Impact of post-thrombotic syndrome)\n    *   Significant improvement in tenecteplase group vs. placebo\n        *   15% vs. 37% had at least 1 adverse outcome, (Difference =22%, 95% C.I for the difference 3.2-40, P=0.017, NNT 5)\n*   Secondary outcomes at 90 day follow up (tenecteplase vs. placebo):\n    *   NYHA class 3/4: 5.4% vs 20.5%, P=0.051,\n    *   6 minute walk distance: 407 vs. 403m, P=0.9\n    *   6 minute walk distance <330m: 16% vs. 28%, P=0.19\n    *   Self assessment of overall health (1-10, 1 worst, 10 best): 3.3 vs. 2.4, P=0.036\n        *   This was the only individual outcome that had a significant improvement\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Treatment with tenectaplase was associated with increased probability of a favourable outcome\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Randomised\n*   Double-blinded\n*   CONSORT diagram\n*   Use of patient orientated outcomes\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Under-powered. Trial terminated early due to lead author relocating to a new institution that led to insurmountable legal and administrative barriers. Is this a first?\n*   Composite outcome that included many variables. Some of these variable are things that would be important to me if I was the patient where as some would not concern me e.g. need for vasopressors. With so many variables included it is difficult to determine what the exact benefits are. Due to the difficulties in recruiting enough patients to determine a mortality difference, future studies will need to utilise similar outcomes. I would prefer these studies to use a simpler approach, have a primary outcome of functional assessment at 3 months and secondary outcomes of mortality and major haemorrhage. This would still require more patients than the present study recruited\n*   Most of the patients (>70%) had heart rates of < 110 & SBP\u2019s > 100mmHg. 50% were troponin or BNP negative. 35% did not even get an echo. Whilst the authors\u2019 have been explicit about their definition of submassive PE, this group is perhaps at a lower risk and does not represent the patients we truly wish to capture\n\n_The study was financially supported by Genetech who make tenecteplase. They were not involved in the study design or data analysis_  \n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients with submassive PE, the use of tenecteplase resulted in a reduction in adverse outcomes based on a complicated composite outcome. However, the **only** independent variable that reached statistical significance was related to a self assessment of overall health at 90 days. This was simply the patients\u2019 response to being asked \u2018how would you rate your overall health?\u2019 (mean was 2.4 vs. 3.3 out of 10). The study was small, under powered and incomplete, which limits any conclusions that can be made. I would not be persuaded to thrombolyse a patient with submassive PE based on this study.\n\n#### Links\n\n[abstract](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484241)\n / doi: 10.1111/jth.12521\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Life in the fast lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/thrombolysis-submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n*   [RAGE podcast](http://ragepodcast.com/tag/submassive-pulmonary-embolus/)\n    \n*   [pulmccm.org](http://pulmccm.org/main/2014/randomized-controlled-trials/tenecteplase-for-submassive-pe-more-conflicting-evidence-topcoat/)\n    \n*   [EMCrit Blog: Fibrinolysis in Pulmonary Embolism](http://emcrit.org/podcasts/fibrinolysis-in-pulmonary-embolism/)\n    \u00a0\n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\nSummary date: 21 June 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/pulmonary-embolism/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/peg-ed/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ivc-filters/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/optalyse-pe/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/topcoat/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Clinical Research in Cardiology 2019; Published online 29 June 2019. doi:10.1007/s00392-019-01521-y\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adults with decompensated heart failure who are at high-risk of diuretic resistance, does furosemide administered by infusion compared to intermittent bolus increase the incidence of freedom from congestion at 72 hours?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Diuretic resistance is a common issue in patients with acute decompensation of advanced chronic heart failure (ACHF)\n*   Controversies exist about the best modality of furosemide administration\n*   The largest prospective double-blind randomized trial ([DOSE study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1005419)\n    ) comparing continuous infusion and intermittent boluses in acute decompensated heart failure demonstrated no significant differences in global assessment of symptoms or in the mean change in the creatinine level\n*   A recent [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30054781)\n     found continuous infusion superior to boluses administration in terms of weight reduction, total urine output, and brain natriuretic peptide reduction\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled trial\n*   Computer generated randomisation sequence with 1:1 ratio\n*   Allocation was concealed by using sequential numbered cases with pre-prepared drug and dummy placebo\n*   Double blind, double dummy design\n    *   Both groups received infusion and bolus, with one being active diuretic and the other being 5% dextrose\n*   Two different doses of furosemide were given depending upon patient characteristics\n    *   This was defined prior to randomisation\n    *   This dose was then given by the randomly allocated method\n*   Designed to assess superiority of continuous infusion over intermittent bolus therapy\n*   Sample size of 78 patients required\n    *   Powered at 70% (False positive rate 30%)\n    *   Significance level 10% (False negative rate 10%)\n    *   Expected absolute difference of 23% (NNT 5)\n        *   Estimated outcome in bolus group 48%\n        *   Estimated outcome in infusion group 25%\n*   Prespecified subgroups (renal function, haemodynamic profile and diuretic dose) was analysed with Bonferroni correction\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Intensive Cardiac Care Unit of University Hospital in Turin\n*   May 2013 to December 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**: adults over 18 years with [advanced chronic heart failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481947)\n    ; ejection fraction < 30%; all of the following risk factors for diuretic resistance:\n    *   Systolic BP < 110 mmHg\n    *   Serum sodium < 135 mmol/L\n    *   Severe congestion ([wet score > 12/18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354029)\n        )\n*   **Exclusion**: Reversible cause of acute heart failure (e.g. acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, valve disease, arrhythmias); cardiogenic shock ([INTERMACS class < 2](https://www.jhltonline.org/article/S1053-2498(09)00191-0/pdf)\n    ); eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2\n*   217 screened; 80 randomised\n*   Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (Intermittent Bolus vs Continuous Infusion):\n    *   Age: 58.7 vs 63 years\n    *   Male: 88% vs 93%\n    *   Ejection Fraction: 19.2% vs 19.4%\n    *   Furosemide daily dose pre-randomisation: 242 mg vs 198 mg\n    *   Proportion that received high-dose furosemide in trial: 80% vs 63%\n        *   P = 0.14 so not sufficiently different to be considered significant\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   **Continuous Infusion of Furosemide**\n    *   The assigned dose of furosemide was given by continuous infusion\n    *   A dummy administration of 5% glucose placebo solution was given by intermittent bolus every 12 hours\n    *   Treatment continued for 72 hours, after which \u2018open label\u2019 treatment was given at the clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Intermittent Bolus of Furosemide**\n    *   The assigned dose of furosemide was given by intermittent bolus every 12 hours\n    *   A dummy administration of 5% glucose placebo solution was given by continuous infusion\n    *   Treatment continued for 72 hours, after which \u2018open label\u2019 treatment was given at the clinician\u2019s discretion\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Patients were given \u2018low dose\u2019 (120 mg/day) unless the following criteria were met, in which case they received \u2018high dose\u2019 (240 mg/day) furosemide:\n    *   Severe systemic congestion (wet score > 14/18)\n    *   Pre-hospital furosemide dose of > 125 mg\n    *   Supplemental metolazone therapy\n*   Furosemide 40 mg or 60 mg was given in the Emergency Department\n*   Maximum time from admission to diuretic treatment was 2 hours\n*   Treatment was protocolised\n    *   If Systolic BP > 90 mmHg, sodium nitroprusside (vasodilator) was infused and titrated\n    *   If hypoperfused state (cold shock), dopamine or dobutamine were infused and titrated\n        *   If high doses were required and shock progressively evolved, vasopressors were started and the patient left the study protocol\n    *   Thiazide diuretics were not allowed\n    *   Fluid restriction of 1000 ml/day\n    *   Strict bed rest\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: freedom from congestion at 72 hours (defined as JVP < 8 cm, and no orthopnoea and with little or no peripheral oedema) occurred more frequently in the Continuous Infusion group\n    *   Continuous Infusion group: 47.5%\n    *   Intermittent Bolus group: 25%\n    *   Absolute Risk Reduction: 22.5% (95% CI 2.02% to 42.98%; P = 0.036)\n    *   Number Needed to Treat: 5 patients\n    *   Fragility Index: ZERO\n        *   P = 0.619 when analysed with Fisher\u2019s exact test\n*   **Secondary outcome**:\n    *   Total urine output was greater in the continuous infusion group\n    *   Treatment failure occurred less often in the continuous infusion group\n    *   Diuretic response was greater (as defined by kg weight loss per 40 mg furosemide) in the continuous infusion group\n    *   Worsening renal function was not different\n    *   Worsening heart failure was not significantly different\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   When administered to adult patients with advanced chronic heart failure and a high risk of diuretic resistance, furosemide administered by continuous infusion achieved better decongestion than furosemide administered by intermittent bolus\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Appropriate methodology to test well-defined hypothesis\n*   Appropriate concealment of random allocation sequence\n*   Excellent double-dummy strategy to maintain blinding of allocation throughout treatment period\n*   Well-defined patient population\n*   Consecutive screening of all admitted patients to avoid selection bias\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Power / sample size calculation does not make sense\n    *   The authors describe a decrease in the primary outcome from 48% in the control group to 25% in the intervention group\n    *   This would be a good thing if the primary outcome was a negative event\n    *   In this trial, the primary outcome was a positive event (freedom from congestion) so the hypothesis is that the intervention group will have a higher incidence of the primary outcome than the control group\n*   Power / sample size calculation is of\u00a0concern\n    *   Usually the control group and intervention group event rates are estimated from prior data\n    *   These estimates are combined with defined Power and significance levels to calculate a necessary sample size\n    *   In this trial, the event rates used in the sample size calculations are exactly the same as the primary outcome results of this trial\n    *   Has the power calculation been performed after the trial to establish the effective power having recruited an arbitrary number of patients?\n*   Power / sample size calculation has not defined Power and significance levels that are generally acceptable in clinical trials\n    *   Usually Power is defined as 80% or 90%, but in this trial they have defined it as 70%, which increases the potential for Type 2 error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when there is a true effect)\n    *   Usually significance is defined as 0.05, but in this trial they have defined it as 0.10, which increases the potential for Type 1 error (rejecting the null hypothesis when there is not a true effect)\n    *   In summary, this trial has a sample size too small to have sufficient power or statistical significance to adequately test the hypothesis, by usual clinical trial standards\n*   Imbalance in furosemide dosing between groups\n    *   Although this difference was not statistically significant, it may have been relevant\n    *   The dosage was higher in the intermittent bolus group, which may have biased in favour of the null hypothesis, so this may have reduced the measured effect\n*   Fragility Index is zero\n    *   When using Fisher\u2019s exact test instead of Chi Squared test, the trial result is no longer statistically significant by the threshold the authors defined\n*   Single centre design reduces generalisability\n*   Predominantly male population may reduce generalisability to females\n*   Tightly defined homogenous population reduces the generalisability to patients with less severe heart failure, those without features suggestive of diuretic resistance and critically ill patients with iatrogenic oedema\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This small and under-powered trial did demonstrate a benefit from continuous infusion of furosemide compared to intermittent boluses in a highly defined subset of patients with advanced chronic heart failure\n*   I will continue to administer furosemide by continuous infusion in my critically ill patients, and unfortunately this trial fails to add any evidence to support or refute this clinical practice\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Diuretic treatment in high-risk acute

NEJM 2014;1-9. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1403285\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In mechanically ventilated adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), does simvastatin compared to placebo reduce ventilator dependence?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Multi-center, double-blind\n*   Randomised in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks and stratification according to study site and vasopressor requirement\n*   Designed with 80% power to detect a difference of 2.6 ventilator-free days from a baseline of 12.7 (SD 10.6), with significance level of 0.05, if 524 patients were recruited\n    *   Allowing for 3% withdrawal, planned to recruit 540 patients\n*   Intention-to-treat statistics\n\n### Setting\n\n*   40 general ICUs in UK and Ireland\n*   December 2010 \u2013 March 2014\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: mechanical ventilation + onset of ARDS within previous 48 hours (PaO2:FiO2 < 300 mmHg, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, no evidence of left atrial hypertension)\n*   Exclusion: pregnancy, contraindications to statins, recent statin administration (within 2 weeks)\n*   5926 patients were screened and 540 were randomised\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Enteral simvastatin 80mg once daily for a maximum of 28 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   Placebo therapy at the same frequency and duration as the intervention group\n\n*   For both groups, ventilation strategy was not defined, but low tidal volume ventilation with plateau pressures maintained below 30 cmH2O were encouraged.\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: there was a small but not statistically significant difference in the ventilator-free days to day 28 between the groups (given as mean\u00b1SD)\n    *   simvastatin group 12.6\u00b19.9 days vs placebo group 11.5\u00b110.4\n    *   mean difference 1.1 days (95% CI -0.6 to 2.8; p=0.21)\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   oxygenation index: no significant difference\n    *   SOFA score: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\n    *   days free of non-pulmonary organ failure to day 28: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\n    *   death within 28 days: no\u00a0significant difference\n    *   death before discharge from hospital: no\u00a0significant \u00a0difference\n    *   safety: significantly more adverse events in simvastatin group (raised CK and raised liver enzymes), but no difference in serious adverse events\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Simvastatin therapy did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Builds upon carefully planned theoretical work, animal, in vitro and phase 1 clinical trials\n*   Multi-centre, pragmatic study design, allowing clinicians to treat as they normally did\n*   Inclusive of all causes of ARDS (c.f. SAILS trial, that focused on sepsis)\n*   A priori publication of protocol and statistical plan\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Statistically significant difference\u00a0between groups\u00a0in baseline PaO2:FiO2 ratio, with simvastatin group having slightly worse ratios: 123 vs. 132.4 mmHg. This will bias toward null hypothesis. A post-hoc statistical adjustment was performed; the between-group difference remained statistically insignificant.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Simvastatin use in ARDS has no benefit, based upon these data.\n*   This trial does demonstrate a good safety profile in the critically ill, although biochemical abnormalities are more likely with simvastatin.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0 [Simvastatin in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome](http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1403285)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Future therapies for ARDS by Curley](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-014-3578-z/fulltext.html)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Statins in the Critically Ill by Life in the Fast Lane](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/statins-critically-ill/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@SteveMathieu75](http://twitter.com/SteveMathieu75)\n and [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 10 December 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\n[ARDS](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/ards/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vent-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/the-rest-trial/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/subira-feature-image-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/dexa-ards/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/background-651746-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/charli/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/harp2/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Pressure supported ventilation was the standard. Both groups were weaned and extubated once pre-defined (and fairly standard) criteria were met. Physical restraints were never used.\n\n### Outcome\n\n**In words**\n\n*   The _primary outcome_, which was the\u00a0number of days without mechanical ventilation in a 28-day period beginning at intubation, favoured the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019.\n    *   The difference between the mean of each group was 4.2 days (95% CI 0.3\u20138.1).\n*   The _secondary outcomes_\u00a0either favoured the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019 (some with statistical significance and some without), or showed no difference, with the exception of the incidence of delirium:\n    *   ICU length of stay \u2013 statistically significant mean difference of 9.7 days\n    *   Hospital length of stay \u2013 statistically significant mean difference of 24 days\n    *   In hospital mortality \u2013 trend toward better outcome with \u2018no sedation\u2019 but not statistically significant\n    *   Brain radio-imaging \u2013 no difference in need\n    *   Accidental extubation \u2013 no difference in occurrence (n=7 \\[13%\\] vs n=6 \\[10%\\], p=0.69)\n    *   Ventilator associated pneumonia (defined as CXR changes and one of fever, \u00a0high or low white cell count, or purulent sputum) \u2013 no difference in occurrence\n    *   Re-intubation \u2013 no difference in need\n    *   Delirium \u2013 greater incidence in the \u2018no sedation\u2019 group (n=11 \\[20%\\] vs n=4 \\[7%\\], p=0.04). This may represent difficulty to detect delirium in sedated patients, rather than a true difference in incidence.\n\n**In numbers**\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Primary Outcome\n| Measure | No Sedation | Sedation | MD  | 95% CI | p   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ventilator-free days  <br>Mean (SD) | 13.8 (11.0) | 9.6 (10.0) | 4.2 days | 0.3\u20138.1 | 0.0191 |\n| \u2018Ventilator-free days\u2019 = number of days from intubation to day 28 where mechanical ventilation was not requires; MD = mean difference; SD = standard deviation; CI = confidence interval; p = p-value |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Secondary Outcomes\n| Measure | No Sedation | Sedation | HR  | AD  |     | p   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ICU LOS  <br>(median days) | 13.1 | 22.8 | 1.86  <br>(95% CI 1.05\u20133.23) | 9.7 |     | 0.0316 |\n| Hospital LOS  <br>(median days) | 34  | 58  | n/a | 24  |     | 0.0039 |\n| Measure | No Sedation | Sedation | OR  | ARR | NNT | p   |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| In-Hospital Mortality | 36% | 47% | 0.65  <br>(95% CI 0.31\u20131.39) | 10.2 | 10  | 0.27 |\n| LOS = Length of Stay; HR = Hazard Ratio; AD = Absolute Difference; OR = Odds Ratio; ARR = Absolute Rate Reduction; NNT/NNH = Number needed-to-treat |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Results from this single-centre study suggest that a strategy of no sedation is promising, but a multi centre trial is needed to show that the benefits of this strategy can be reproduced in other facilities.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Authors designed trial to question their own established practice.\n*   Control group were treated as per previously published protocol by Kress, allowing direct comparison.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   There was a baseline difference in patient gender, with a greater proportion of women being allocated to the control group. Although not reported, this difference is statistically significant (p=0.05 by Fisher\u2019s exact test). Given the adequate concealment of allocation, this is likely to have occurred by an outside chance. In my opinion, it is unlikely that this gender difference will have affected the observed primary or secondary outcomes, but that cannot be said with certainty.\n*   Given the intervention of \u2018no sedation\u2019 was the institution\u2019s normal practice, and the complete lack of any blinding, there is an inherent bias towards finding a larger difference in favour of the intervention (i.e. a more positive outcome). This also reduces the external validity, as there may be a learning curve associated with using \u2018no sedation\u2019.\n*   19% of the randomised patients were excluded from data analysis (modified intention-to-treat analysis) as they were extubated or dead within 48 hours. Whilst this is a common method (see Kress for example), I would like to see mortality and length of stay data including these patients. Unbiased and fair randomisation should minimise any bias from this modified analysis.\n*   10 (18%) patients in the \u2018no sedation\u2019 group deviated from protocol and received continuous sedation. This will reduce the observed difference, and highlights the difficulty with applying this \u2018no sedation\u2019 strategy despite their expertise and staffing.\n*   The outcome measures were reported as corrected for baseline characteristics using multiple linear regression statistics. Although the uncorrected findings were still statistically significant (p=0.035), it may have been better to report all raw data then a selection of corrected data.\n*   Non-standard definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia.\n*   Additional staffing was required to support 20% of the \u2018no sedation\u2019 patients, compared to 5% of the \u2018sedation\u2019 patients. This additional resource may outweigh any benefit from a reduced length of stay. The 24 hour availability of an ICM specialist doctor may also reduce the generalisability to units with less staffing.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study should make clinicians question the dogma of sedation in ICUs, but clinical practice should not change immediately because of this study alone.\n*   A strategy of \u2018no sedation\u2019 may be feasible in ICUs, but may require additional staffing.\n*   Further multi-centre trials are required with patient-centred outcomes and cost-analyses.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[Original article abstact\\]\u00a0[A protocol of no sedation for critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation: a randomised trial by T Strom](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)62072-9/abstract)\n    \n*   \\[PhD thesis paper\\]\u00a0[Sedation on ICU by T Strom](http://www.danmedj.dk/portal/pls/portal/!PORTAL.wwpob_page.show?_docname=9020914.PDF)\n    \n*   \\[Editorial\\] [Less sedation in intensive care: the pendulum swings back by L Brochard](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60103-1/fulltext)\n    \n*   \\[Critique\\] [Pushing the envelope to reduce sedation in critically ill patients by O Ogundele](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220044/)\n    \n*   \\[Critique\\] [An appraisal of \u2026 by G Harlow](http://journal.ics.ac.uk/pdf/1202147.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\]\u00a0[Daily Interruptions of Sedation in Mechanically Ventilated Patients by C Nickson](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/daily-interruptions-of-sedation-in-mechanically-ventilated-patients/)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [Sedation and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit by M Reade and S Finfer](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1208705)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [Critical Care Challenge: Sedation and Delirium in the Intensive Care Unit by S Finfer and J-L Vincent](http://www.nejm.org/doi/story/10.1056/feature.2014.01.14.21)\n    \n*   \\[SOP \u2013 Academic Department of Critical Care, Portsmouth\\] [Sedation and Delirium in Critical Care](http://www.portsmouthicu.com/resources/SedationandDelirium2014.pdf)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 10th July 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@davidslessor](http://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\n[Sedation](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sedation/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2-1-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/mends2/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/artificial-intelligence-3382507-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nonseda/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/rose-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/rose/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/strom/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The light could be turned off and on in the room and could be changed to bright settings of 1000 lux for emergencies and procedures\n\n### For both intervention and control group\n\n*   Identical lighting system (Philips Dynalite DUS804C, Philips Lighting) was installed in every ICU room\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome:\u00a0Cumulative incidence of ICU-acquired delirium (comparing intervention and control)\n    *   No significant difference (38% vs 33%, Odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0/92-1.68, p=0.16)\n*   Secondary outcomes: comparing intervention\u00a0vs. control group\n    *   No statistically significant difference in any of the outcome measures\n        *   Delirium free days: 26 vs 27 (P=0.29)\n        *   Duration of mechanical ventilation: 20h vs 19hr (P=0.67)\n        *   Length of ICU stay: 4 days vs 4 days (P=0.82)\n        *   ICU mortality: 12% vs 14% (P=0.42)\n        *   Length of hospital stay: 15 days vs 16 days (P=0.84)\n    *   No significant difference on further analysis in:\n        *   Use of sedative agents\n        *   Use of haloperidol\n        *   Hospital mortality\n        *   Excretion profile of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin or cortisol (biochemical markers of circadian rhythm)\n*   Mean cumulative daytime lighting levels between 0600h and 1800h were significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group: 5366 vs 2793 lux (P<0.0001). Outside this period, mean lux was similar in both groups\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In critically ill patients\u00a0the use of continuous lighting therapy was not effective in reducing the cumulative incidence or the duration of ICU-acquired delirium compared to normal lighting.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   RCT\n*   Separation of intervention and control light profile achieved\n*   CAM-ICU score is recognised and validated for use of assessing delirium. This was measured three times each day\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Single centre\n*   Main exclusion criteria was that the patient was expected to spend < 24h on ICU. Duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in both groups 19-20h which is short\n*   Incidence of delirium in control group lower than that used for power calculations\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Dynamic light therapy at supranormal levels conferred no benefit above natural lighting. Delirium on the ICU remains common and difficult to treat. I will continue my usual practice of daily sedation breaks, early mobilisation and orientation therapy on the ICU\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Dynamic light application therapy to reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in intensive-care patients: a randomised controlled trial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(16)00025-4/abstract)\n    \n*   \\[FOAMed\\]\u00a0[Sleep and ICU](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/sleep-and-icu/)\n    \n*   \\[FOAMed\\]\u00a0[http://ICUdelirium.co.uk](http://ICUdelirium.co.uk)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[\u2018In a dark place, we find ourselves\u2019: light intensity in critical care units](https://icm-experimental.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40635-017-0122-9)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@avkwong](http://www.twitter.com/avkwong)\n  \nSummary date: 6th February 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Delirium](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/delirium/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Humanising ICU](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/humanising-icu/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 3 comments\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b70363d0a3e7e0af814bdc7acda3ae8e?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Duncan Chambler\n    \n    [17 February 2017 at 11:02 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#comment-526)\n    \n    Adrian, thanks for your summary and critique. This is a fascinating theory, which unfortunately this trial has not supported.\n    \n    From the data you\u2019ve presented (I admit I haven\u2019t had a chance to read the paper yet), it appears they did not recruit the number of patients they intended to. As the incidence of delirium was 38% vs 33%, the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI) is 5% (which is smaller than the 10% they deemed clinically relevant in their power calculation). By recruiting only 75% of their target, the 95% CI for this ARI are -1.62% to 12.14% (i.e. the null hypothesis cannot be rejected), but if they had continued to 1000 patients and if the incidence remained the same in each group, then the 95% CI would have been 0.81% to 9.19%. From this, we might have concluded that dynamic light therapy is harmful, causing delirium in 1 patient for every 20 treated (i.e. NNH 20).\n    \n    Therefore, I think this trial is unable to conclude that dynamic light therapy has no effect on delirium but I completely agree with you that this trial demonstrates it does not have a clinically meaningful positive impact on delirium, unfortunately.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/?replytocom=526#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c3e73bf56cff907abc4195faf9554ac?s=56&d=mm&r=g) [avkwong](http://gravatar.com/avkwong)\n    \n    [18 February 2017 at 8:49 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#comment-527)\n    \n    Agree with power calculations.\n    \n    I think its an interesting theory though and as you say, its disappointing results. Given the drive for non-pharmacological interventions e.g. orientation therapy for delirium. My unit is located in the basement of the hospital with little natural light (Unlike Steve\u2019s unit). I do think the lack of light not only affects patients, but also staff. It would be very interesting to do a bit and after if/when we move to a new unit build.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/?replytocom=527#respond)\n    \n*   Pingback: [Nishikimi \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/nishikimi/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/dynamic-light-application-therapy-to-reduce-the-incidence-and-duration-of-delirium-in-intensive-care-patients-a-randomised-controlled-trial/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

JAMA 2013; 309:2121-2129. doi:10.1001/jama.2013.5154\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In mechanically ventilated adult patients with a high risk of prolonged ventilation, does early tracheostomy compared with late tracheostomy reduce mortality at 30 days?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Large, multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial\n*   Pilot study and national survey to estimate baseline prevalence\n*   Block randomisation with minimisation algorithm to prevent imbalance between health centre, age, sex and 7 diagnostic groups\n*   Clinicians, patients and data analysts not blinded\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis\n*   Multiple power calculations due to changing baseline and ultimately recruitment fatigue\n    *   Final recruitment was powered to detect 8.3% absolute reduction in 30-day mortality from a baseline of 31.5%, with 80% power and 5% accepted significance level.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   70 adult, general Intensive Care Units across the UK\n    *   13 university associated\n    *   59 non-university associated\n*   November 2004 to November 2008\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Any intubated and ventilated adult patient where, on day 4, the treating clinician believes the patient will require at least 7 more days of ventilatory support\n*   Exclusion: If a tracheostomy is already in situ, or one is required for specific patient management (e.g. airway obstruction); chronic hypercarbia from neurological disease\n*   3147 patients assessed of which 909 were randomised.\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Placement of tracheostomy within 4 days of critical care admission\n    *   84.6% received tracheostomy as planned\n    *   14.5% not managed as planned because:\n        *   6.8% never received a tracheostomy (died, too unstable, or recovered)\n        *   7.7% received it \u2018late\u2019 (too unwell, no resources, transiently improved, trial error)\n\n### Control\n\n*   Placement of tracheostomy on or later than day 10, and only then if still deemed clinically indicated\n    *   93.6% were managed as per trial protocol\n        *   39.9% received tracheostomy on or later than day 10\n        *   53.7% were deemed no longer indicated and did not receive a tracheostomy\n    *   7.3% received tracheostomy before day 10 (clinical decision, insistence by relatives, trial error)\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: all-cause mortality at 30-days was not statistically different between the two groups\n    *   Early 30.8% vs late 31.5%\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   There were no differences in survival at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, 1-year and 2-year follow-up\n    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation favoured early tracheostomy but this did not reach statistical significance\n        *   Early 13.6 days vs late 15.2 days; reduction in mean duration 1.7 days; p=0.06\n    *   Median length of ICU stay were the same: early 13.0 days vs late 13.1 days\n    *   Only within the 30-day-surviving sub-group, there were statistically significantly fewer days of sedation administration in the early group: early 5 days vs late 8 days (p<0.001)\n    *   Antibiotic use (as a proxy for hospital acquired infections) were not different between the two groups\n*   Other data:\n    *   The incidence of complications overall was 6.3% (95% CI 4.6\u20138.5%), of which bleeding requiring fluid administration was most common\n    *   89% were percutaneous and 11% were surgically performed\n    *   The median duration of the procedures was 30 minutes\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In mechanically ventilated adult patients, there is no mortality benefit from performing an early tracheostomy.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   National study with all centres invited to take part: excellent external validity\n*   Robust methodology\n*   Meaningful outcome with 2 year follow-up\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Recruitment fatigue led to lower than planned patient numbers\n*   Did not include patients requiring tracheostomy for non-respiratory reasons, such as neurological disease\n*   Did not look at long-term complications and morbidity associated with tracheostomy\n*   Inclusion was reliant on clinicians identifying patients at high risk of prolonged ventilation, with no validated scoring system to assist decision making. This study shows that 19.6% recovered before day 10 in the late group, suggesting that clinician judgement is not good for this.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial does not provide evidence supporting early tracheostomies performed around day 4 compared to day 10 (_no evidence of difference_).\n*   Tracheostomy procedures are associated with a 6.3% incidence of complications requiring interventions, which must be weighed against any potential benefit.\n*   Many commentators have interpreted this trial to mean there is no benefit from performing early tracheostomies (_evidence of no difference_), as many will not need it if we wait until day 10.\n*   However, some patients need tracheostomies for good reasons (e.g. neurological disease) and they were not included in this study.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[open access article\\]\u00a0[Effect of Early vs Late Tracheostomy Placement on Survival in Patients Receiving Mechanical Ventilation](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1690674)\n    \n*   \\[Trial website\\]\u00a0[TracMan.org.uk](http://www.tracman.org.uk/)\n    \n*   \\[Editorial\\] [When Should a Mechanically Ventilated Patient Undergo Tracheostomy by Angus](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1690679)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [Timing of Tracheostomy by LITFL](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/timing-of-tracheostomy/)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [CAT review.

JAMA 2018;320(8):779-791. doi:10.1001/jama.2018.11597\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adult patients with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, does a supraglottic airway device compared with tracheal intubation as the initial advanced airway management strategy, improve functional neurological outcome?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Optimal airway management during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is uncertain because there is very little high-quality research on which to base treatment recommendations\n*   The advanced procedure of tracheal intubation has been considered a definitive airway management technique. However, the introduction of a supraglottic airway (SGA) device offers an alternative advanced airway management technique during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest\n*   Insertion of a SGA device is usually simpler and faster than tracheal intubation and proficiency requires less training and ongoing practice\n*   Another\u00a0study ([PART](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2698491)\n    ) assessing the effect of a strategy of initial laryngeal tube insertion versus endotracheal intubation on 72-Hour Survival in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was also published in the same issue of JAMA as AIRWAY-2\n\n### Design\n\n*   Multicenter, cluster randomised trial\n*   Paramedics from 4 ambulance services in England\n*   Every eligible patient treated by a participating paramedic was automatically enrolled in the study under a waiver of consent\n*   Paramedics were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a purpose- designed secure internet-based system. The computer- generated random sequence was done in advance using varying block sizes and stratified by EMS provider organisation, paramedic experience, and distance from the paramedic\u2019s base ambulance station to the usual destination hospital\n*   Paramedic discretion with choosing the airway device was permitted and in fact was necessary to secure approval from the research ethics committee and professional support\n*   9070 patients in total were needed to detect a difference of 8% vs 10% at the significance level of 5% with 90% power after allowing for clustering. This was based on a previous feasibility study for mortality. There was no data available for the modified Rankin Scale score and an improvement of 2% in the proportion of patients achieving a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) was judged to be clinically important\n\n### Setting\n\n*   4 ambulance services in England\u00a0which combined provide service to 21 million people\n*   June 2015 and August 2017\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Patients aged 18 years or older who had a non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were treated by a\u00a0 paramedic participating in the trial\n*   Exclusion: previously recruited to the trial (determined retrospectively); resuscitation deemed inappropriate; advanced airway already in place (inserted by another paramedic, physician, or nurse) when a paramedic participating in the trial arrived at the patient\u2019s side; known to be enrolled in another prehospital RCT; patient\u2019s mouth opened less than 2 cm\n*   9296 patients (4886 in the SGA group; 4410 in the Tracheal Intubation group) were enrolled; 4882 and 4407 patients respectively were included in the primary outcome analysis\n*   Baseline demographics were well matched:\n    *   median age was 73 years\n    *   3373 were women (36.3%)\n    *   median time from emergency call to paramedic arrival within one minute between groups\n    *   presenting rhythm (50% asystole; 22% VF)\n    *   witnessed cardiac arrest 63%\n    *   CPR before paramedic arrival 63%\n    *   defibrillation before paramedic arrival 3%\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Supraglottic airway device used as initial advanced airway management\n    *   Second generation device with a soft non-inflatable cuff (i-gel; Intersurgical)\n        *   82% patients received SGA device first\n        *   15% did not receive airway management\n        *   2.4% received tracheal intubation first\n\n### Control\n\n*   Tracheal intubation used as initial advanced airway management\n    *   performed using direct laryngoscopy; video laryngoscopy is not used by paramedics in England\n    *   a 2-person technique using a bougie was recommended\n        *   62% patients received tracheal intubation first\n        *   22% did not receive airway management\n        *   14% received SGA device first\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   There was a standard approach to airway management (from basic to advanced techniques) which included the use of bag-mask ventilation and simple airway adjuncts prior to advanced airway management\n*   End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring was used to confirm correct device placement in all patients.\n*   All other care was delivered according to standard international resuscitation guidelines\n*   Paramedics received additional training in their allocated advanced airway management intervention immediately after randomisation. Training comprised theoretical and simulation-based practice over 1 hour with a brief assessment to confirm competence\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: There was no statistical difference in the [Modified Rankin Scale](https://www.mdcalc.com/modified-rankin-scale-neurologic-disabilityhttps://www.mdcalc.com/modified-rankin-scale-neurologic-disability)\n     score at hospital discharge or 30 days after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whichever occurred sooner\n    *   In the SGA group, 311 of 4882 patients (6.4%) had a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score range, 0-3) vs 300 of 4407 patients (6.8%) in the TI group (adjusted risk difference \\[RD\\], \u22120.6% \\[95% CI, \u22121.6% to 0.4%\\])\n\nModified Rankin Scale score was divided into 2 ranges: 0-3 (good outcome) or 4-6 (poor outcome to death)\n\n*   Secondary outcomes, comparing SGA vs intubation\n    *   No significant difference in:\n        *   survival status: died at scene 53.7% vs 56.5%;

It is reasonable to attribute this to an improvement in antibiotic practice or adoption of all interventions of the SSC. However, Australia & New Zealand data demonstrated a lower mortality of 35% back in 2000, [Kaukonen et al, JAMA 2014](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1850096)\n    )_\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   \u2018Effective antimicrobial administration within the first hour of documented hypotension was associated with increased survival to hospital discharge in adult patients with septic shock. Despite a progressive increase in mortality rate with increasing delays, only 50% of septic shock patients received antimicrobial therapy within 6 hours of documented hypotension\u2019\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   A large cohort study involving 10 different institutions\n*   Clinically high relevance and importance\n*   Diagnostic criteria for site-specific infections clearly documented in Appendix\n*   For any scenarios regarding data collection which had not been covered by predetermined rules, data was reviewed independently by two infectious disease/intensivists blinded to outcome. Discordant assessments were reviewed by a third physician whose decision was determinate\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Non-randomised\n*   Study spanned from 1989 \u2013 2004. Introduces temporal confounding with changes in practice\n*   Unclear how many patients were included from each of the 3 cohorts. There were \u2018approximately 150\u2019 from each of the 3 American academic institutions.\n*   38% of the patients had indications for source control (either open surgical or percutaneous) but there is no information regarding when (or even if) this happened\n*   \u2018Questionable cases or data elements\u2019 were reviewed by the Principal Investigator for adjudication. A second independent adjudicator would have reduced the risk of clinician bias\n*   No data presented about organ dysfunction (lactate, renal function, other organ support)\n*   Minimal information presented about vasoactive drugs, assessment of fluid responsiveness and fluid resuscitation measures\n*   The study was supported by unconditional grants from a number of pharmaceutical industries. However, they had no role in the design, data collection or writing of the report.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study is a landmark paper in critical care practice. The message is powerful. Early and appropriate antibiotic therapy saves lives. The methodology of the paper is not without some significant limitations but a randomised controlled trial is not likely to ever occur now. Source control and early appropriate antibiotics will remain an integral part of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\] [Kumar.

NEJM 2017; September 27. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1707572\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients requiring transfusion, does the transfusion of the freshest available red cells compared to standard care impact on patient mortality?\n\n### Background\n\n*   When blood is stored there is concern that the storage lesion impacts on patient safety. Red cells become spiculated over time impacting on their transit through capillary beds and oxygen carriage. Hospital donation services need guidance as to safe storage times. There is some variation across centres ranging\u00a0 from 35-42 days. In addition it is not known if certain subgroups of patients would benefit from receiving fresher blood compared with long-term storage of blood.\n*   There have been several studies investigating whether fresh blood is superior to blood near its used by date. The [ABLE](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/able/)\n     trial looked at ICU patients and randomised them to receive blood that was less than 8 days old or older blood. However, there were several limitations to this study, including a relatively small sample size and exclusion of more than 700 potentially eligible patients due to lack of availability of \u2018fresh blood.\u2019\n*   The INFORM trial was a large trial of over 10000 all hospital patients with a subgroup of critically ill patients. Similarly patients were randomized to fresh or old blood. The critically ill subgroup had a lower than expected mortality making it difficult to generalize the results to a sick ICU population.\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial 1:1 allocation\n*   Double blind (concealment of blood collection and expiration dates)\n*   Computer-generated allocation concealment\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   ICU patients; prespecified supgroups\n    *   APACHE III with analysis of death above and below the median\n    *   ABO blood group; O vs non-O\n    *   SOFA\n*   Logistic regression to determine heterogeneity between intervention and control groups\n*   Further secondary analysis\n    *   analysis of impact of duration of storage independent to group allocation in quartiles and as a continuous variable\n*   Sample size calculation: 4664 patients required to detect an absolute difference of 4.2% for 90 day day mortality, from a baseline of 28%, with a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 5%.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   59 sites in 5 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Finland, Saudi Arabia)\n*   Dates: November 2012 \u2013 December 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: patients hospitalized in ICU expected to stay at least 24 hours, who need transfusion (as decided by caring doctors) of at least one RBC unit\n*   Exclusion\n    *   Age < 18\n    *   Previous RBC transfusion during current admission\n    *   Transplant or haematologic diseases\n    *   Pregnancy\n    *   Cardiac surgery patients (due to low mortality rates)\n    *   Death imminent (< 24 hours)\n    *   Objection by treating physician\n    *   Known patient objection to receive transfusion\n*   4994 randomized; 2490 assigned to short-term storage blood, 2504 assigned to long-term storage blood\n*   Comparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention group:\n    *   Baseline characteristics were similar although the age differed by 1 year which was a statistically significant difference (due to the large sample size). The data was therefore analyzed with an adjustment to this age difference.\n    *   Number of red cell units transfused: 4.1 vs. 4.0\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Transfusion of the freshest available blood\n    *   Mean storage duration of transfused blood 11.8+-5.3 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   Transfusion of the oldest available compatible blood (<36 days old, or <42 days in Australia/Saudi Arabia)\n    *   Mean storage duration of transfused blood 22.4 +-7.5\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Blood was leukodepleted\n*   All other management was as per the ICU treating teams\n*   The mean transfusion threshold was 77.4g/L in the short-term storage group and 77.3g/L in the long-term group.\n*   After ICU discharge if patients required further transfusion the original allocation assigned would be adhered to.\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: Death at 90 days \u2013 no significant difference\n    *   Short-term storage 24.8%. Long-term storage 24.1%. unadjusted OR 1.04 (0.91-1.18, p=0.57), adjusted OR 1.05 (0.92-1.21, p=0.46)\n*   Secondary outcomes: (Short-term vs Long-term blood)\n    *   No significant difference in:\n        *   28 or 180 day mortality\n        *   Persistent Organ Dysfunction combined with death at day 28\n        *   Days alive and free of mechanical ventilation at Day 90\n        *   Days alive and free of renal replacement therapy at Day 90\n        *   Blood stream infection in ICU\n        *   Length of ICU and hospital stay\n    *   Febrile non-haemolytic tranfusion reactions; occurred more frequently in the short-term storage group (123 events {5%} vs 88 events {3.6%}), absolute risk difference = 1.4% (95% CI, 1.07-1.88, p=0.01)\n    *   Analysis of quartiles depending on age of transfused blood and independent of group allocation: no significant difference\n*   Sub-group analysis\n    *   Analysis of patients with the higher risk of death (APACHE III > than the median of 21.5%):\n        *   90 day mortality significantly greater in the short-term storage group\n            *   37.7% vs. 34%, OR 1.18 (95% CI, 1.00-1.39, p = 0.05)\n    *   ABO-group transfusion: no significant difference\n    *   SOFA score <7 or >7: no significant difference\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/trasnfuse.jpg)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   There is no difference in 90 day mortality in patients transfused the freshest available red cells versus standard issue\n    *   Patients who had short-term storage blood had more febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reactions\n    *   Patients who had short-term storage blood with greater than median APACHE III risk of death had increased mortality\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Large sample size, meticulous design and execution of the trial ensure these results are the best evidence we have for this clinical question\n*   Near complete follow-up and analysis adjusted to baseline difference of age\n*   Only 1% of patients did not receive the blood they were suppose to\n*   Multi-centred and Multi-country\n*   The age of the blood in the groups was significantly separated by 10.6 days meaning the trial achieved what it aimed to\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   1353 eligible patients did not undergo randomisation\n*   The finding of more febrile non-haemolytic reactions in the fresh blood group should be considered exploratory\n*   The finding of higher mortality in the sicker patient group is of unknown significance\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This important study confirms that there is no benefit gained from using the freshest blood available in the blood bank for transfusing critically ill patients. Conversely it also confirms that there is no harm from using the oldest blood in the blood bank to transfuse critically ill patients\n*   Although this study will not change my practice it puts the question of \u201cIs Fresh Best\u201d to rest\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[TRANSFUSE: Age of Red Cells for Transfusion and Outcomes in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1707572)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ABLE](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1500704#t=article)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[INFORM trial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1609014)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Celia Bradford](https://twitter.com/celiabradford?lang=en)\n  \nSummary date: 28th September 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Segun Olusanya](https://twitter.com/iceman_ex?lang=en)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Transfusion](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/transfusion/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/transfuse/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

In patients with cerebral atrophy the onset of symptoms may be insidious and may be detected some time after a minor head trauma or be associated with anticoagulation therapy\n*   The management of chronic SDH includes surgical evacuation of the clot if there is evidence of neurological deterioation or if the clot is >10mm or is causing midline shift of >5mm\n*   Systemic reviews of the use of glucocorticoids in CSDH have suggested that they reduce the chance of clot recurrence however the effect on neurological outcome is not known to date\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial: 1:1 randomisation of a 14 day tapering course of dexamethasone OR placebo\n*   Permuted blocks (random block sizes of 2 or 4) with stratification according to trial site\n*   Allocation concealment achieved via a web-based allocation tool\n*   Double-blinding: both the treating clinicians and outcome assessors were unaware of the allocation\n*   Powered to allow for a 15% loss to follow-up. Target sample size of 750 patients would allow a 81-92% power to detect a treatment effect of 8 percentage points\n*   Consent obtained from the patient or next-of-kin\n*   An independent data monitoring committee and ethics committee reviewed the trial at 6-12 monthly intervals\n\n### Setting\n\n*   23 sites in the United Kingdom\n*   Patients were enrolled from August 2015 to November 2018, with 6-month follow-up completed by mid 2019.\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**: Patients >18 years with a symptomatic CSDH seen as a hypodense or isodense crescentic collection on the CT head\n*   **Exclusion**:\n    *   Glucocorticoids were contraindicated\n    *   Glucocorticoids were indicated for other medical conditions\n    *   CSF shunt in situ\n    *   History of psychotic disorder\n    *   Patients with acute SDH\n    *   Patients who were unable to receive the trial drug within 72 hours after admission\n*   2203 were screened for eligibility. 750 were randomised to a trial group (2 were subsequently deemed not eligible). So 748 patients were enrolled with 375 in the dexamethasone group and 373 in the placebo group\n*   45 patients withdrew consent and 23 were lost to follow-up leaving 680 patients in the modified intention to treat analysis\n*   Patients were well matched at baseline: they were predominantly elderly males (74 years, 74% male) with the most common presenting symptoms being headache and gait disturbance, with head trauma historically noted in around 70% of cases. 47% were on some form of antithrombotic medication\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Dexamethasone\n    *   2-week course of oral dexamethasone\n        *   8mg bd Day 1-3, 6mg bd Day 4-6, 4mg bd on Day 7-9, 2mg bd on Day 10-12 then 2mg daily on Day 13-14. (If the patient could not swallow they had NG delivery of the dexamethasone)\n\n### Control\n\n*   Matched placebo\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Other management was at the discretion of the treating clinicians and was not protocolised\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: 6 month modified rankin score (MRS) \u2013 significantly better outcomes in placebo group\n    *   This scale has 7 categories. 0=no symptoms, 1=no clinically significant disability despite symptoms, 2=slight disability, 3=moderate disability, 4=moderately severe disability, 5=severe disability, 6=death\n    *   Comparing dexamethasone vs. placebo group\n        *   A favourable outcome, (MRS of 0-3)\n            *   83.9% vs. 90.3% \u00a0(-6.4% difference, 95% CI -11.4 to -1.4)\n*   **Secondary outcomes**: Comparing intervention vs. control group\n    *   Significantly better outcomes in control group\n        *   MRS 0-3 at 3 months\n            *   83.2% vs 91.4% (-8.2%, 95% CI -13.3 to -3.1)\n        *   Mortality at 30 days\n            *   2.1% vs 0.5% (OR 4.08, 95% CI 1.01 to 27.2)\n    *   No significant difference in\n        *   MRS 0-3 at discharge from neurosurgical unit\n            *   80.2% vs 83.2%, (-3% 95% CI -9.1 to 3)\n        *   Mortality at 6 months\n            *   8.8% vs 5%, (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.45)\n        *   Surgical intervention in the index admission\n            *   91.7% vs 89.2%\n        *   Surgical intervention in a subsequent admission\n            *   5.1% vs 7.6%\n    *   Significantly reduced in intervention group\n        *   Repeat surgery for recurrence of subdural haematoma\n            *   1.7% vs 7.1% (-5.4%, 95% CI -8.7 to -2.5)\n    *   Adverse events \u2013 significantly more likely in the dexamethasone group\n        *   Adverse events of special interest\n            *   10.9% vs 3.2%\n        *   Serious adverse events up to Day 30\n            *   16% vs 6.4% (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.54-4.15)\n        *   Subdural empyema more common in dexamethasone group\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In patients with symptomatic chronic subdural haematoma, treatment with dexamethasone resulted in fewer favourable outcomes and more adverse events compared with placebo. However, recurrence of the subdural haematoma, requiring repeat surgery was less likely in the dexamethasone group\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Allocation concealment\n*   Blinding\n*   Patients were analysed in the group they were allocated to even if they didn\u2019t receive the therapy\n*   Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding those who withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up\n*   Multi-centre study improving external validity of results\n*   The study picked a clinically meaningful outcome as the primary outcome. Previous studies of dexamethasone in CSDH had used recurrence of SDH as the outcome which is not as important to the patient as neurological recovery\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent in 9% which was accounted for in the power calculation\n*   10 patients assigned to the dexamethasone group did not receive this\n*   12 patients assigned to placebo received dexamethasone\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Patients with chronic subdural haematoma should not be treated with dexamethasone\n*   This study is reassuring that my usual practice of not using dexamethasone in this cohort is the correct approach\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   [Trial of Dexamethasone for Chronic Subdural Haematoma](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2020473)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: Celia Bradford @celiabradford  \nSummary date: 12/1/21  \nPeer-review editor: @davidslessor\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Head Injury](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/head-injury/)\n[Neurology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/neurology/)\n[Perioperative Care](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/perioperative-care/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/dex-csdh/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The other adverse events did not differ between groups.\n\n![tbl-hypress-data-table](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tbl-hypress-data-table-1.png)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Administration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   An important question: the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock is one of the longest running debates in critical care. This trial uniquely\u00a0examines the use of steroids to prevent shock in patients with established sepsis.\n*   Allocation concealment\n*   Blinding\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   <5% lost to follow-up\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed because informed consent was necessary before randomisation\n*   The mortality rate in this trial was relatively low (8.5% at Day 28) so this was a relatively well cohort compared to other sepsis trials (reflecting the haemodynamic stability of the\u00a0patients at the time of randomization)\n*   Not all patients had baseline adrenal function assessed. Only certain sites did this test and it needed to be done before randomization occurred.\n*   Etomidate was used in 6.3%\u00a0(placebo group)\u00a0and 6.8% (hydrocortisone group)\u00a0of patients pre-randomization. Etomidate selectively inhibits adrenal corticosteroid synthesis which may impact the overall result\n*   Patients in the placebo arm were more likely to have received glucocorticoids pre-randomization and at higher doses (3.4% vs 1.7%, 600mg vs 200mg), but the number of patients involved was small.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   As a non-believer in\u00a0the use of steroids in sepsis and septic shock I will continue my current practice of not using steroids in this setting.\n*   I am\u00a0working at a hospital actively recruiting for the ADRENAL trial. 3800 patients with septic shock\u00a0are being recruited in a placebo-controlled trial\u00a0to assess 90 day mortality. I keenly await these results which may put this question to rest forever!\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[HYPRESS RCT](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2565176)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ADRENAL trial protocol](https://www.cicm.org.au/CICM_Media/CICMSite/CICM-Website/Resources/Publications/CCR%20Journal/Previous%20Editions/June%202013/05_2013_Jun_The-ADRENAL-study.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Podcast: Cohen Steroids in Sepsis](http://intensivecarenetwork.com/728-smacc-cohen-steroids-in-sepsis/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0Celia Bradford  \nSummary date:\u00a0October 12 2016  \nPeer-review editor: Duncan Chambler\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Shock](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/shock/)\n[Steroids](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/steroids/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 4 comments\n\n*   Pingback: [The HYPRESS Trial: Early Steroids to Prevent Septic Shock - R.E.B.E.L.

It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m guessing that lyophilised mannitol has a similar consistency and colour to the drug, to make it indistinguishable. The dosage, as Celia noted, is tiny compared to a therapeutic mannitol dose (less than 1%), so I don\u2019t think it can lead to lower blood pressure. Trials are so carefully considered when being designed, so I doubt the authors would have done this if they weren\u2019t sure. That\u2019s not a particularly critical or scientific answer from me though!\n        \n        [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/hypress/?replytocom=601#respond)\n        \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/hypress/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

However with this study excluded the results for the primary outcome were still statistically significant\n*   The authors report that study methods were assessed for risk of bias, but this is not reported in the results. MAPPETT-3 and PEITHO provide 1/3 of patients for this meta-analysis, and both have weaknessness of concern.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Thrombolysis for PE is associated with a lower all cause mortality when compared to anticoagulation. This improvement is maintained in the subgroup of \u2018intermediate risk\u2019 PE with a NNT of 65. This is despite a significant increase in major bleeding in the thrombolysis group, with a NNH of 18. Of note, patients who were\u00a0\u226465 years had no increase in major bleeding with thrombolysis.\n*   With the MOPETT and TOPCOAT studies finding improved longterm outcomes with regards to pulmonary hypertension, and self assessment of overall health in the thrombolysis groups, this meta-analysis provides a convincing argument for the use of thrombolysis in submassive PE.\n*   If I have a submassive PE, I want thrombolysis. (I am under 65 years). I would want half-standard dose as per the MOPETT trial. If my dad (he is over 65 years) had a sub-massive PE I would not recommend thrombolysis as the 12.9% chance of major bleeding means that the risks may outweigh the benefits.\n\n#### Links\n\n[abstract](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1881311)\n\u00a0/ doi: 10.1001/jama.2014.5990\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [pulmcrit](http://www.pulmcrit.org/2014/06/thrombolysis-reduces-mortality-in.html)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n\u00a0and\u00a0[@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 29 June 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Pulmonary Embolism](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/pulmonary-embolism/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/20-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/peg-ed/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ivc-filters/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/optalyse-pe/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/chatterjee/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

However, this was changed prior to knowledge of the outcome data\n*   Differences in the baseline characteristics between the intervention and the control group\n*   Large numbers of patients randomised\u00a0who had exclusion criteria\n*   Non-blinding of clinicians and patients\n*   Small numbers of patients included\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This small randomised controlled trial demonstrated that patients with ICH who are on antiplatelet agents have worse neurological outcomes at 3 months if they are treated with a platelet transfusion compared with standard care alone. The trial has a number of weaknesses but\u00a0this is the best evidence we have and I do not think we should be using platelet transfusions for these patients outside of a clinical trial.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Platelet transfusion versus standard care after acute stroke due to spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2816%2930392-0/abstract)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[St Emlyns journal club](http://stemlynsblog.org/jc-platelets-intracranial-haemorrhage-st-emlyns/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[REBEL EM The PATCH Trial](http://rebelem.com/patch-trial-hold-platelets-spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[EMLit of Note: Put the Platelets Away in ICH](http://www.emlitofnote.com/2016/05/put-platelets-away-in-ich.html)\n    \n*   \\[further trial awaited\\]\u00a0[Platelet Transfusion in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00699621)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date:\u00a021st June 2016  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0@duncanchambler\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Haematology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/haematology/)\n[Neurology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/neurology/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 2 comments\n\n*   Pingback: [The PATCH Trial: Hold the Platelets in Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage? - R.E.B.E.L.

In patients with refractory VF beta-blockade should be considered\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Clear inclusion/exclusion criteria\n*   Standardised dosing of esmolol\n*   Reported use of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation\n*   Reported patient-orientated outcomes\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Retrospective\n*   Small sample size\n*   Non-randomised, non-blinded. Unclear why some patients treated with esmolol and others were not. Unclear why different rates of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation between the two groups\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   The use of esmolol for refractory VF was associated with a dramatic, but non significant, improvement in mortality. This association may be due to a causal effect of esmolol. However, the small sample size or confounding variables such as the use of therapeutic hypothermia and emergent cardiac catheterisation may also account for the differences found. Further studies are required. In the mean time, if I have a patient with refractory VF, with no other treatment options available such as cardiac catheterisation I will use esmolol prior to stopping resuscitation.\n*   Survival with good neurological outcome can be achieved with prolonged CPR (56-68 minutes)\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[\\[Use of esmolol after failure of standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation to treat patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation.\\]](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25033747)\n    \n*   \\[Further Reading\\]\u00a0[LITFL Electrical Storm or Refractory VF/VT](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/electrical-storm/)\n    \n*   \\[Further Reading\\]\u00a0[UMEM Educational Peals](https://umem.org/educational_pearls/2037/)\n    \n*   \\[Podcast\\]\u00a0[EMCrit Intra-arrest](http://emcrit.org/podcasts/new-intra-arrest/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[@davidslessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 17 Dec 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@DuncanChambler](https://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Cardiac Arrest](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiac-arrest/)\n[Cardiology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiology/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Designer-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/danger-shock-microaxial-flow-pump-in-infarct-related-cardiogenic-shock/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/milad-fakurian-58Z17lnVS4U-unsplash-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/validation-of-the-miracle-2-score-for-prognostication-after-oohca/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f56f382c8210ec4d5bebef98da418c92?s=56&d=mm&r=g) David Slessor\n    \n    [19 August 2016 at 12:13 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/esmolol-vf/#comment-368)\n    \n    some more evidence for the use of esmolol here  \n    [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27523955](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27523955)\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/esmolol-vf/?replytocom=368#respond)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/esmolol-vf/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

JAMA. Published online June 03, 2019321(23):2292\u20132305. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.7505\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In obese patients, does the use of recruitment maneuvers with high PEEP, compared with low PEEP, decrease postoperative pulmonary complications?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Prior studies have identified the use of PEEP and low tidal volumes for reduction of major pulmonary complications compared to high tidal volumes and zero PEEP\n*   No benefit was found in these patients with the use of high PEEP and recruitment compared to low PEEP strategies\n*   Obese patients have greater levels of atelectasis and impairments in respiratory function under general anesthesia compared to normal weight or overweight patients\n*   There is uncertainty whether higher PEEP with recruitment is beneficial in preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in these patients\n*   With an increasing prevalence of obesity, the burden of postoperative pulmonary complications may increase significantly\n\n### Design\n\n*   International, multicentre RCT with protocol and statistical analysis plan published a priori\n*   Centralized randomization and 1:1 allocation\n*   Random block sizes, stratified by study site\n*   Outcome assessors were blinded, intraoperative clinicians and assessors were not blinded\n*   Sample size increased after initial interim analysis demonstrated that incidence of primary outcome was lower than expected\n*   Assuming 20% rate of pulmonary complications, sample size of 2013 would have 80% power to detect Relative Risk of 0.75 for the primary outcome at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis\n*   Pre-specified subgroups: Laparoscopy vs non-laparoscopy, baseline SpO2 > 96% vs. < 96%, BMI > 40 vs. < 40, peripheral vs. upper abdominal procedures, waist-to-hip ratio < 1.0 vs. > 1.0\n\n### Setting\n\n*   77 sites in 23 countries internationally, primarily in Europe\n*   Enrolment from July 2014 to February 2018\n\n###

-0.01)\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   High PEEP with recruitment manoeuvre\n    *   PEEP of 12cmH2O (SD 1.1cmH2O)  \n        Hourly recruitment manoeuvre\n    *   Stepwise increase in tidal volume and PEEP to achieve Pplat of 40-50 cm H2\n    *   Hypoxemia treated primarily with increase in PEEP before FiO2 increased\n\n### Control\n\n*   Low PEEP\n    *   PEEP of 4cmH2O (SD 0.5cmH2O)\n    *

liver failure) \u2013 no significant difference\n        *   Hospital mortality \u2013 no significant difference\n            *   1.2% vs. 0.5%, AD 0.7 (-0.1 to 1.5), p=0.09\n*   Post Hoc Outcomes\n    *   Intra-operative rescue strategy for desaturation \u2013 significantly greater in low PEEP group\n        *   6% vs. 16.8%, AD -10.8 (-13.6 to -8.1), p<0.001\n    *   Intra-operative need for

with a strategy involving high PEEP and recruitment did not reduce postoperative pulmonary complications compared to low PEEP strategy in obese patients under general anesthesia\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Adequately powered study with adjusted sample size\n*   Multi-centre\n*   Generalizable population with minimal inter-group differences, of questionable clinical importance\n*   Intention to treat analysis with minimal exclusion post-randomization\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Lack of intraoperative blinding given pragmatic design\n*   No individual PEEP titration\n*   Lack of standardization of postoperative pulmonary management (ex CPAP vs HFNC vs FM, etc)\n*   Use of composite outcome that included outcomes of variable importance\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In obese patients undergoing general anesthesia, a strategy with higher PEEP and recruitment maneuvers does not prevent post-op pulmonary complications\n*   Intra-operative oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics may be improved at the risk of increased vasopressor support\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Effect of Intraoperative High Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) with Recruitment Maneuvers vs Low PEEP

These were well matched although no statistical data was conducted\n*   No conflict of interest declared. Supported by the French Ministry of Health\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Number of patients excluded \u2013 98 due to physician refusal and 409 due to \u2018other reasons\u2019\n*   Based on results found, the study had a power of 85% to detect an absolute reduction of 15% mortality, from a baseline mortality of 40%. A benefit as great as this is probably unrealistic and there could still be large differences that this trial was not powered to detect\n*   No mention of time to antibiotic therapy although standard treatment and adequate initial antibiotic cover similar\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   There was no significant difference found between the use of adrenaline vs. noradrenaline\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0dobutamine in patients with septic shock. However, the study was under-powered and with a trend towards harm in the adrenaline group, highlights the need to conduct larger studies before considering adrenaline as the first agent for the management of septic shock. I will continue to reach for noradrenaline for patients with septic shock. The study does provide some reassurance that adrenaline infusion is a reasonable alternative in the early phase of shock or in resource limited settings.\n\n#### Links\n\n[Full text pdf](http://www.amedeoprize.com/ap/lancet_djillali.pdf)\n\u00a0/\u00a0[abstract](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61344-0/abstract)\n\u00a0/ doi:\u00a010.1016/S0140-6736(07)61344-0\n\n#### Editorial, Commentaries or Blogs\n\n*   [Catecholamine treatment for shock \u2013 equally good or bad?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17719998?access_num=17719998&link_type=MED&dopt=Abstract)\n    \u00a0Lancet 2007\n*   [Choice of vasopressor in septic shock: does it matter?](http://ccforum.com/content/11/6/174)\n     Crit Care 2007\n*   [Epinephrine: Is it really the black sheep of vasoactive agents?](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911701/)\n     Crit Care 2010\n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DavidSlessor](https://twitter.com/davidslessor)\n  \nSummary date: 30th April 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Shock](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/shock/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Designer-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/danger-shock-microaxial-flow-pump-in-infarct-related-cardiogenic-shock/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ACORN-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/acorn/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/cats/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

NEJM 2017; September 27. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1707572\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients requiring transfusion, does the transfusion of the freshest available red cells compared to standard care impact on patient mortality?\n\n### Background\n\n*   When blood is stored there is concern that the storage lesion impacts on patient safety. Red cells become spiculated over time impacting on their transit through capillary beds and oxygen carriage. Hospital donation services need guidance as to safe storage times. There is some variation across centres ranging\u00a0 from 35-42 days. In addition it is not known if certain subgroups of patients would benefit from receiving fresher blood compared with long-term storage of blood.\n*   There have been several studies investigating whether fresh blood is superior to blood near its used by date. The [ABLE](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/able/)\n     trial looked at ICU patients and randomised them to receive blood that was less than 8 days old or older blood. However, there were several limitations to this study, including a relatively small sample size and exclusion of more than 700 potentially eligible patients due to lack of availability of \u2018fresh blood.\u2019\n*   The INFORM trial was a large trial of over 10000 all hospital patients with a subgroup of critically ill patients. Similarly patients were randomized to fresh or old blood. The critically ill subgroup had a lower than expected mortality making it difficult to generalize the results to a sick ICU population.\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial 1:1 allocation\n*   Double blind (concealment of blood collection and expiration dates)\n*   Computer-generated allocation concealment\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   ICU patients; prespecified supgroups\n    *   APACHE III with analysis of death above and below the median\n    *   ABO blood group; O vs non-O\n    *   SOFA\n*   Logistic regression to determine heterogeneity between intervention and control groups\n*   Further secondary analysis\n    *   analysis of impact of duration of storage independent to group allocation in quartiles and as a continuous variable\n*   Sample size calculation: 4664 patients required to detect an absolute difference of 4.2% for 90 day day mortality, from a baseline of 28%, with a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 5%.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   59 sites in 5 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Finland, Saudi Arabia)\n*   Dates: November 2012 \u2013 December 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: patients hospitalized in ICU expected to stay at least 24 hours, who need transfusion (as decided by caring doctors) of at least one RBC unit\n*   Exclusion\n    *   Age < 18\n    *   Previous RBC transfusion during current admission\n    *   Transplant or haematologic diseases\n    *   Pregnancy\n    *   Cardiac surgery patients (due to low mortality rates)\n    *   Death imminent (< 24 hours)\n    *   Objection by treating physician\n    *   Known patient objection to receive transfusion\n*   4994 randomized; 2490 assigned to short-term storage blood, 2504 assigned to long-term storage blood\n*   Comparing baseline characteristics of control vs. intervention group:\n    *   Baseline characteristics were similar although the age differed by 1 year which was a statistically significant difference (due to the large sample size).

Conversely it also confirms that there is no harm from using the oldest blood in the blood bank to transfuse critically ill patients\n*   Although this study will not change my practice it puts the question of \u201cIs Fresh Best\u201d to rest\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[TRANSFUSE: Age of Red Cells for Transfusion and Outcomes in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1707572)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[ABLE](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1500704#t=article)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[INFORM trial](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1609014)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Celia Bradford](https://twitter.com/celiabradford?lang=en)\n  \nSummary date: 28th September 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Segun Olusanya](https://twitter.com/iceman_ex?lang=en)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Transfusion](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/transfusion/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/transfuse/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Crit Care Med 2014; 38:367-374. doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000000330\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, is the timing of first administration of antibiotics associated with the in-hospital mortality rate?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Retrospective observational cohort study\n*   Utilised data from voluntary Surviving Sepsis Campaign database\n*   Adequacy of screening, inclusion and data accuracy not checked\n*   Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) used for population-level average\n\n### Setting\n\n*   165 intensive care units across Europe, United States and South America\n*   January 2005 to February 2010\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: patients admitted to ICU with a suspected infection, two or more SIRS criteria and one or more organ dysfunction criteria (that is, severe sepsis or septic shock)\n*   Exclusion: if antibiotics were not given (1.6%), if antibiotics had already been given (32%) or if it was unclear when they were given (3.0%).\n*   28,150 screened and 17,990 analysed after the above exclusions.\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Timing of antibiotics\n    *   stratified into 0\u20131 hr, 1\u20132 hrs, 2\u20133 hrs, 3\u20134 hrs, 4\u20135 hrs, 5\u20136 hrs and > 6 hrs\n    *   appropriateness of antibiotics, and the specific drug and dosage were not analysed\n\n### Controlled factors\n\n*   Authors tested the impact of 51 covariates in the model.

That is, there is significant possibility that the observed difference in outcome between <1 hr and 1\u20132 hrs may be due to chance alone.\n\n#### In numbers\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Adjusted hospital mortality\n| Time | OR  | p   | Mortality | 95% CI | NNH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| <1  | 1.00 | \u2013   | 24.6% | 23.2\u201326.0 | \u2013   |\n| 1\u20132 | 1.07 | 0.165 | 25.9% | 24.5\u201327.2 | 73  |\n| 2\u20133 | 1.14 | 0.021 | 27.0% | 25.3\u201328.7 | 35  |\n| 3\u20134 | 1.19 | 0.009 | 27.9% | 25.6\u201330.1 | 25  |\n| 4\u20135 | 1.24 | 0.006 | 28.8% | 25.9\u201331.7 | 19  |\n| 5\u20136 | 1.47 | <0.001 | 32.3% | 28.5\u201336.2 | 8   |\n| \\>6 | 1.52 | <0.001 | 33.1% | 30.9\u201335.3 | 7   |\n| Baseline is taken as \u2018<1\u2019 cohort.

Although it is commendable that they sought to provide evidence for the guidelines, they may have cognitive biases in favour of finding an association. Could this be repeated by a different, unassociated research group?\n*   As highlighted in previous SSC publications (see Levy and Dellinger link below), the quality, accuracy and completeness of the dataset was not verified\n*   Inherently, other unanticipated confounding factors may exist\n*   Zero time was the point of identification and diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients may have already developed severe sepsis or septic shock some time before this but then went undiagnosed. Therefore \u2018zero time\u2019 has subjectivity. This is a weakness of all similar studies and will be difficult to overcome. It is unlikely to reduce the validity of the conclusion though.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This larger and broader observational study addresses a question that cannot ethically be answered by a randomised, controlled trial.\n*   It provides strong evidence that the time between diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock and the first dose of antibiotics is critical.\n*   Whether there exists a difference between 0\u20131 hour and 1\u20132 hours could be debated, but greater than 2 hours is almost certainly associated with a higher rate of hospital mortality.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[Article abstract\\]\u00a0[Empiric Antibiotic Treatment Reduces Mortality in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock From the First Hour: Results From a Guideline-Based Performance Improvement Program by Ferrer et al.](http://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000000330)\n    \n*   \\[Editorial\\] [The Golden Hour of Antibiotic Administration in Severe Sepsis: Avoid a False Start Striving for Gold by van Zanten.](http://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000000363)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\]\u00a0[The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: results of an international guideline-based performance improvement program targeting severe sepsis by Levy and Dellinger et al.](http://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181cb0cdc)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [Duration of hypotension before initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is the critical determinant of survival in human septic shock by Kumar.](http://doi.org/10.1097/01.CCM.0000217961.75225.E9)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\] [Antibiotic Timing by LITFL.](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/education/ccc/antibiotic-timing/)\n    \n*   \\[Further reading\\]\u00a0[Statistical Analysis of Correlated Data Using Generalized Estimating Equations: An Orientation by Hanley et al.](http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/157/4/364.full)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [@DuncanChambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date: 1 August 2014  \nPeer-review editor:\u00a0[@stevemathieu75](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\n[Microbiology](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/microbiology/)\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/REvise-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/revise-stress-ulcer-prophylaxis-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/delirium-city-oracle-eyes-4090949-1-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/arie-trial-rifaximin-for-encephalopathy/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/ferrer/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

The benefit of revascularisation of chronic total occlusions is unclear particularly in the cardiogenic shock setting, and so mandated revascularisation of these lesions may have contributed to the worse outcomes observed in the multi-vessel PCI group\n*   50% of patients required resuscitation prior to PCI, it would be more useful to have neurological status as a more patient-centred outcome\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock, a more targeted PCI strategy may be more beneficial excepting that further intervention (PCI and hospitalisation) may be required in the future\n*   The results of this trial supports the most recent change in European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Myocardial Revascularisation 2018 where intervention to non-culprit lesions has been downgraded from level II to level III\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [One-year outcomes after PCI strategies in cardiogenic shock](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1808788)\n    \n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[PCI strategies in patients with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock.

JAMA 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.16628\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adult patients suffering an in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) does the use of vasopressin and methylprednisolone compared to a placebo result in increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)?\n\n### Background\n\n*   IHCA in the UK has an occurrence of 1:1000 admissions (~13000 per annum) and is poorly studied compared to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) with few large scale trials\n*   IHCA has been described as a [different entity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007985/)\n     to OHCA\n    *   Different aetiologies and often shorter time to recognition and effective CPR (and defibrillation if appropriate)\n*   It has been [reported](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31462205/)\n     that further strategies are needed to improve outcomes\n*   In 2013, the [VSE trial](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vse-vasopressin-steroids-and-epinephrine-and-neurologically-favourable-survival-after-in-hospital-cardiac-arrest-a-randomized-clinical-trial/)\n     showed improved survival to hospital discharge with\u00a0 favourable neurological outcome with the addition of vasopressin and steroids alongside adrenaline\n*   It has been shown that endogenous vasopressin levels are lower in non-survivors of cardiac arrest\n*   Likewise, cortisol levels have been demonstrated to be higher in those successfully resuscitated\n    *   It is thought this might relate to the cardiovascular effects of glucocorticoids such as increased sensitivity, increased production of enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis and inhibition of breakdown\n*   A 2019 [Cochrane Review](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003179.pub2/full)\n     concluded that vasopressin compared to standard dose adrenaline in OOHCA improved survival to admission but not ROSC, whereas the combination of vasopressin and adrenaline had no effect on these outcomes\n\n### Design\n\n*   Investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind, superiority trial\n*   Randomised in a 1:1 ratio\n    *   Random blocks of 2,4 or 6 used and blocks stratified by site\n*   Trial drugs brought to patient in blinded study kit by a dedicated member of the clinical cardiac arrest team\n*   Pre-specified secondary and safety outcomes alongside 5 subgroups\n*   Clinical data (SOFA score) collected at 24,48 and 72 hours post IHCA\n*   Neurological outcomes assessed at 30,90, 180 days and 1 year post IHCA\n*   Sample size calculation required 492 patients\n    *   alpha of 0.05 and power 80%\n    *   Based on unpublished data showing IHCA ROSC rate of 45% in placebo group and 13% absolute difference in ROSC rates between groups\n*   Consent sought from patients or surrogates if survived\n    *   Temporary

subgroup\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VAMIHCA-2.jpg)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The administration of vasopressin and methylprednisolone, compared  \n    to a placebo, significantly increased the likelihood of  \n    return of spontaneous circulation\n*   Uncertainty remains as to whether this treatment results in long term survival benefit or harm\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Important question to answer given previous benefits shown in trials in an area with few trials with large numbers recruited\n*   A large trial in a logistically challenging area\n    *   IHCA are often fraught environments and enrolling, randomising and administering study drug within 9 minutes is notable\n*   Good internal validity\n    *   Multicentre\n    *   Double blinded, placebo controlled\n    *   Good randomisation strategy\n    *   Balanced baseline characteristics\n    *   Good adherence to protocol\n        *   18 deviations in vasopressin / methylprednisolone group vs 19 in placebo\n    *   Pre-published [protocol](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666520421000060?via%3Dihub)\n        \n*   Sensible primary outcome\n    *   The use of adrenaline in cardiac arrest algorithms is only based on increased rates of ROSC and 3 month survival\n        *   Its use does not alter long term survival or survival with a favourable neurological outcome\n    *   The authors note that to adequately power a study to detect a 2% difference in neurological outcome would require > 7000 patients\n    *   Rates of ROSC may not seem patient focused however:\n        *   Families might value this time as a chance to say goodbye\n        *   There were [increased rates of organ donation](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03271-0/tables/1)\n             in the [PARAMEDIC2](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/paramedic2/)\n             trial\n*   It seems reasonable to not place too much weight on the neurological outcome given:\n    *   It was not powered to detect this\n    *   There are some discrepancies between the various scoring tools of neurological outcome:\n        *   The rates of CPC 1 and 2 at 90 days were identical, this is contrast to the point estimate favouring harm for the mRS score at both 30 and 90 days (however neither were significant)\n        *   The EQ-5D-5L (a health related QoL metric) point estimates were higher in the vasopressin / methylprednisolone group at both 30 and 90 days (again neither significant)\n\n### \u00a0Weaknesses\n\n*   High numbers excluded \u201cfor other reasons\u201d\n    *   Mostly clearly documented with valid reasons however 170 (7% of those screened) excluded due to \u201cphysician preference\u201d and in 193 (8% of those screened) \u201cteam forgot\u201d\n        *   This may introduce a selection bias\n*   Only performed in one country (Denmark)\n*   Rates of ROSC lower than study was powered for\n    *   Achieved 33% in control, powered for a 45% rate of ROSC\n    *   This may introduce a type 1 error\n*   In prior study that showed improved neurological function, steroids were continued for 7 days following ROSC\n    *   In those surviving > 24 hours there were higher rates of glucocorticoid use in the placebo group\n*   Higher rates of extracorporeal support in placebo group\n*   Low rates of TTM overall (27 v 26%)\n    *   Despite the [TTM2](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/ttm2/)\n         trial results there is no data provided as to the number who were febrile. Additionally, the TTM trials studied OOHCA and no trial is yet to compare TTM to no TTM\n*   Overall 30d survival low\n    *   The UK 2019/2020 [National Cardiac Arrest Audit](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Ncaa/Reports/Key-Statistics)\n         showed 24% survival to hospital discharge. This is similar to a [systematic review of IHCA outcomes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imj.13039)\n         in ANZ\n*   Theoretically those patients with normal conduction (i.e. PEA) may benefit more from high doses of vasopressors as opposed to shockable rhythms\n    *   This may be evidenced by the subgroup analysis looking at shockable vs non-shockable\n    *   This study had high rates of PEA (57% v 52%) so may not be as applicable to IHCA cohorts that have higher rates of shockable or asystolic rhythms\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   At present there is insufficient evidence to include the use of vasopressin and methylprednisolone as standard care in the management of IHCA\n*   However, given the evidence base for the use of adrenaline in cardiac arrest algorithms it will be interesting to see the recommendations of expert committees if further trials demonstrate a survival benefit\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Trial](https://jamanetwork.com.acs.hcn.com.au/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784625)\n    \n*   \\[editorial\\] [Vasopressin and Steroids as Adjunctive Treatment for IHCA](https://jamanetwork.com.acs.hcn.com.au/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784626)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [European Resuscitation Council 2021 Guidelines](https://cprguidelines.eu/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482460/#R32)\n    \n*   \\[podcast\\] [Critical Care Reviews: VAM-IHCA](https://criticalcarereviews.com/livestream/vam-ihca)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: George Walker [@hgmwalker89](https://twitter.com/hgmwalker89?lang=en)\n  \nSummary date: 9th October 2021  \nPeer-review editor:David Slessor\n\nPicture by: Pexels \\[Allec Gomes\\]\n\n[Cardiac Arrest](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/cardiac-arrest/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### One comment\n\n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2d5a890bb9fa9434f81d1e4aa9a430d3?s=56&d=mm&r=g) Eliana\n    \n    [23 October 2021 at 4:45 pm](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vam-ihca/#comment-33218)\n    \n    Rates of ROSC lower than study was powered for.

Once study drug one was commenced, the open labelled vasopressor was weaned off as quickly as possible\n\n**Study drug 1**\n\n*   Vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) or Norepinephrine (titrated up to 12 \u03bcg/min)\n    *   administered via a central venous catheter\n    *   titrated to maintain the target mean arterial pressure 65 to 75 mm Hg, but this could be altered by the treating physician\n\n**Study drug 2**\n\n*   Hydrocortisone (50mg 6 hourly and then weaned) or Placebo\n    *   study drug 2 was administered once the maximum infusion rate of study drug 1 was reached\n    *   administered as an intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, every 12 hours for 3 days, and then once daily for 3 days\n    *   study drug 2 could be weaned more quickly if the shock had already resolved\n\n**In all groups**\n\n*   If the patient was still hypotensive after the first dose of study drug 2 then additional open-label catecholamine vasopressors could be administered\n*   Open-label catecholamine vasopressors were reduced first and only once the patient was weaned off open-label vasopressors was study drug 1 then reduced\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: the number of days alive and free of kidney failure (defined by [AKIN group stage 3](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc5713)\n    ) separated into two outcome measures:\n    *   28 day survivors who never developed kidney failure: no difference between groups\n        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 56.8%\n        *   vasopressin + placebo: 57.1%\n        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 59.7%\n        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 59.2%\n        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute difference: -2.3 \\[95% CI -13.0 to 8.5\\]\n    *   median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for those patients that did not survive and/or who experienced kidney failure\n        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 5 days (IQR 0-23)\n        *   vasopressin + placebo: 12 days (IQR 1-25)\n        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 13 days (IQR 0-25)\n        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 14 days (IQR 1-24)\n        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute Difference: \u22124 days \\[95% CI \u221211 to 5\\]\n\n[![VANISH2](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)\n\n*   Secondary outcomes: Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group compared with the\u00a0norepinephrine group. These patients were mostly the non-survivors\n*   Other secondary outcomes: no significant difference between groups for:\n    *   28 day, ICU or hospital mortality rates\n    *   Kidney failure rate\n    *   Use of inotropes and shock reversal\n    *   Mean SOFA scores\n    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation\n    *   ICU and hospital length of stay\n    *   Serious adverse events (including digital or mesenteric ischaemia, life-threatening arrhythmia and acute coronary syndrome)\n        *   10.7% in the vasopressin group vs 8.3% in the norepinephrine group; difference, 2.5% \\[95% CI, \u22123.3% to 8.2%\\]\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Among adults with septic shock,the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure\u2013free days\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   An important clinical question comparing vasoactive drugs and the interaction of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock\n*   Drug ampoules were masked by overlabeling on the body and neck of normal drug ampoules. Matching placebo ampoules were used\n*   All clinical staff and researchers were blinded\n*   The baseline characteristics of the groups were well matched for APACHE II score, co-morbidities (including risk of renal injury such as pre-exisiting chronic kidney disease and diabetes), median fluid volume received in the first 4 hours and infection source (primarily lung)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy and levels of haemodynamic monitoring were not controlled, other than specifying that sites should follow the international guidelines\n*   Short time outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed\n*   No health economic analysis \u2013 the lower rate of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin-treated patients could be important\n*   72% of patients received study drug 2. Only 35% of patients received steroid treatment. The power to assess an interaction between steroids and vasopressors, particularly vasopressin is therefore limited\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Early vasopressin maintains blood pressure and reduces the requirement for norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy. However, vasopressin does not reduce the number of renal replacement free days or mortality rate, and there was no clinical interaction with corticosteroids\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\]\u00a0[Effect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney Failure in Patients With Septic Shock:\u00a0The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2540403)\n    \n*   \\[trial protocol\\]\u00a0[Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in Septic sHock (VANISH)](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/7/e005866.full)\n    \n*   \\[Podcast\\] [VANISH.

Once study drug one was commenced, the open labelled vasopressor was weaned off as quickly as possible\n\n**Study drug 1**\n\n*   Vasopressin (titrated up to 0.06 U/min) or Norepinephrine (titrated up to 12 \u03bcg/min)\n    *   administered via a central venous catheter\n    *   titrated to maintain the target mean arterial pressure 65 to 75 mm Hg, but this could be altered by the treating physician\n\n**Study drug 2**\n\n*   Hydrocortisone (50mg 6 hourly and then weaned) or Placebo\n    *   study drug 2 was administered once the maximum infusion rate of study drug 1 was reached\n    *   administered as an intravenous bolus every 6 hours for 5 days, every 12 hours for 3 days, and then once daily for 3 days\n    *   study drug 2 could be weaned more quickly if the shock had already resolved\n\n**In all groups**\n\n*   If the patient was still hypotensive after the first dose of study drug 2 then additional open-label catecholamine vasopressors could be administered\n*   Open-label catecholamine vasopressors were reduced first and only once the patient was weaned off open-label vasopressors was study drug 1 then reduced\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: the number of days alive and free of kidney failure (defined by [AKIN group stage 3](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc5713)\n    ) separated into two outcome measures:\n    *   28 day survivors who never developed kidney failure: no difference between groups\n        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 56.8%\n        *   vasopressin + placebo: 57.1%\n        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 59.7%\n        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 59.2%\n        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute difference: -2.3 \\[95% CI -13.0 to 8.5\\]\n    *   median number of days alive and free of kidney failure for those patients that did not survive and/or who experienced kidney failure\n        *   vasopressin + hydrocortisone: 5 days (IQR 0-23)\n        *   vasopressin + placebo: 12 days (IQR 1-25)\n        *   Norepinephrine + hydrocortisone: 13 days (IQR 0-25)\n        *   Norepinephrine + placebo: 14 days (IQR 1-24)\n        *   Vasopressin vs. Norepinephrine absolute Difference: \u22124 days \\[95% CI \u221211 to 5\\]\n\n[![VANISH2](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VANISH2.png)\n\n*   Secondary outcomes: Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin group compared with the\u00a0norepinephrine group. These patients were mostly the non-survivors\n*   Other secondary outcomes: no significant difference between groups for:\n    *   28 day, ICU or hospital mortality rates\n    *   Kidney failure rate\n    *   Use of inotropes and shock reversal\n    *   Mean SOFA scores\n    *   Duration of mechanical ventilation\n    *   ICU and hospital length of stay\n    *   Serious adverse events (including digital or mesenteric ischaemia, life-threatening arrhythmia and acute coronary syndrome)\n        *   10.7% in the vasopressin group vs 8.3% in the norepinephrine group; difference, 2.5% \\[95% CI, \u22123.3% to 8.2%\\]\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Among adults with septic shock,the early use of vasopressin compared with norepinephrine did not improve the number of kidney failure\u2013free days\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   An important clinical question comparing vasoactive drugs and the interaction of corticosteroids in patients with septic shock\n*   Drug ampoules were masked by overlabeling on the body and neck of normal drug ampoules. Matching placebo ampoules were used\n*   All clinical staff and researchers were blinded\n*   The baseline characteristics of the groups were well matched for APACHE II score, co-morbidities (including risk of renal injury such as pre-exisiting chronic kidney disease and diabetes), median fluid volume received in the first 4 hours and infection source (primarily lung)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Timing of initiation of renal replacement therapy and levels of haemodynamic monitoring were not controlled, other than specifying that sites should follow the international guidelines\n*   Short time outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed\n*   No health economic analysis \u2013 the lower rate of renal replacement therapy in the vasopressin-treated patients could be important\n*   72% of patients received study drug 2. Only 35% of patients received steroid treatment. The power to assess an interaction between steroids and vasopressors, particularly vasopressin is therefore limited\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Early vasopressin maintains blood pressure and reduces the requirement for norepinephrine and renal replacement therapy. However, vasopressin does not reduce the number of renal replacement free days or mortality rate, and there was no clinical interaction with corticosteroids\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[abstract\\]\u00a0[Effect of Early Vasopressin vs Norepinephrine on Kidney Failure in Patients With Septic Shock:\u00a0The VANISH Randomized Clinical Trial](https://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2540403)\n    \n*   \\[trial protocol\\]\u00a0[Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of VAsopressin versus Noradrenaline as Initial therapy in Septic sHock (VANISH)](http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/7/e005866.full)\n    \n*   \\[Podcast\\] [VANISH.

JAMA 2020; Published online January 17, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.22176\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   Does treatment with vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with hydrocortisone alone?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection\n*   A [study published in the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32989-7/fulltext)\n     shows that in 2017, an estimated 48\u00b79 million incident cases of sepsis were recorded worldwide and 11\u00b70 million sepsis-related deaths were reported, representing 19\u00b77% of all global deaths\n*   High-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C has recently been explored as an adjunctive therapy in sepsis because of its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. An RCT ([Fowler, 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24484547)\n    ) of 24 patients showed that high-dose IV vitamin C attenuated organ failure associated with sepsis in a dose-dependent manner. Thiamine deficiency has also been reported in 20% of critically ill patients with sepsis ([Donnino 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20646908)\n    ), and thiamine supplementation has been shown to improve lactate clearance in patients with sepsis ([Woolum 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028362)\n    )\n*   The combination of high-dose IV vitamin C and hydrocortisone together with thiamine was assessed in a single-center retrospective before-and-after study of 94 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock ([Marik 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940189)\n    ). The intervention was associated with shorter duration of vasopressor administration and lower hospital mortality\n\n### Design\n\n*   Pilot, feasibility, multi-centre, randomised, open-label, phase IIb clinical trial\n*   Random allocation sequence was generated at the coordinating center using computer-generated random numbers with permuted block sizes of 2, 4, and 6 in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site\n*   Sample size was initially calculated from a [retrospective before and after study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27940189)\n     with 126 patients required based on an SD of 42 vasopressor-free hours up to day 7. This was then updated from the pooled SD for the first 60 patients enrolled in the study, and the required sample size was recalculated.\n    *   Based on an updated SD of 51.6 hours, the study was estimated to require 180 patients to have 90% power (2-sided \u03b1\u2009=\u2009.05) to detect a difference in vasopressor-free hours of 25\n    *   As the distribution of the primary outcome was expected to be nonparametric, and nonparametric tests have been shown to have decreased statistical power compared with parametric tests, the sample size was inflated by 15% (189 patients). Finally, to account for consent withdrawal (5%), a total of 216 patients were planned to be enrolled.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   10 intensive care units in Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil\n*   May 2018 to July 2019\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**: Patients admitted to a study intensive care unit (ICU) with a primary diagnosis of septic shock based on the Sepsis-3 consensus definition. This involves ALL of the following criteria being met:\n    *   suspected or documented infection\n    *   acute increase of at least 2 points in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score\n    *   lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L\n    *   vasopressor dependence for at least 2 hours at the time of enrollment\n*   **Exclusion**: age younger than 18 years, a do-not-resuscitate order, imminent death, diagnosis of septic shock longer than 24 hours ago, known or suspected disease with a strong indication or contraindication for any of the study drugs, and another indication for hydrocortisone than septic shock\n*   786 patients were screened; 216 were randomised; 5 patients (2 in the intervention group and 3 in the control group) either withdrew or refused consent to continue participation and withdrew all data, leaving 211 patients\n*   At baseline, patients in the intervention group had lower APACHE III scores, had higher lactate and white blood cell counts, and were more likely to have received milrinone. The primary sites of infection were predominantly pulmonary and gastrointestinal in the two groups\n    *   Mean age, 61.7 years\n    *   133 men \\[63.0%\\] and 78 women \\[37.0%\\]\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Received IV vitamin C (1.5 g every 6 hours), hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), and thiamine (200 mg every 12 hours)\n*   The study intervention continued until cessation of vasopressor administration or when any of the other criteria for stopping the study intervention were met. These were:\n    *   Shock resolution; defined as when all vasopressors were discontinued for four consecutive hours in the presence of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg or a target MAP set by the treating clinician\n    *   10 days of vitamin C and thiamine has been administered in the Vitamins group\n    *   7 days of hydrocortisone and tapering, if applicable, has been delivered in the Control group\n    *   Death\n    *   Discharge from the ICU\n    *   Contraindications to any of the study drugs has arisen\n    *   Serious adverse events suspected to be related to a study medication has developed\n    *   Consent withdrawn or consent to continue not granted\n\n### Control\n\n*   Received IV hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours)\n*   thiamine administration was allowed at the discretion of attending ICU clinicians but not vitamin C\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: There was no significant difference in the median time alive and free of vasopressors up to day 7 after randomisation between the intervention group and the control group\n    *   122.1 hours \\[IQR, 76.3-145.4\\] vs 124.6 hours \\[IQR, 82.1-147.0\\]\n    *   Median difference between groups, \u20130.6 hours \\[95% CI, \u20138.3 to 7.2\\]; P\u2009=\u2009.83\n\n[![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-19-at-10.41.31.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-19-at-10.41.31.png)\n\n_**Time alive and free of vasopressors** meant the patient was alive at discontinuation of all intravenous vasopressors for at least 4 hours in the presence of a MAP>65 mmHg or target MAP set by treating physicians._ _If a patient died while receiving vasopressor therapy following the index episode of septic shock, the patient was assigned zero hours for this outcome. If a patient was weaned from all vasopressors for 4 consecutive hours, then all of the remaining time through day 7 was treated as success, even if the patient died or had vasopressors restarted after weaning within the 7-day period_\n\n_**Use of vasopressors** defined as any use of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, (\\*metaraminol, dopamine, or phenylephrine). Total vasopressor doses was calculated as the sum of norepinephrine doses and epinephrine and vasopressin doses were converted to equivalent norepinephrine doses._ _\\*Patients receiving metaraminol monotherapy did not contribute to total vasopressor dose data, and no patients received dopamine or phenylephrine_\n\n*   **Secondary outcomes**: Of 10 pre-specified secondary outcomes, only one (change in SOFA score at day 3) showed a statistically significant difference\n*   **Adverse Events:**\u00a0reported for 2 patients (2 events, fluid overload and hyperglycemia) in the intervention group and 1 patient (1 event, gastrointestinal bleeding) in the control group. No serious adverse events or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported\n\n[![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-19-at-03.54.47.png)](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-19-at-03.54.47.png)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In patients with septic shock, treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine, compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone, did not significantly improve the duration of time alive and free of vasopressor administration over 7 days. The finding suggests that treatment with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine does not lead to a more rapid resolution of septic shock compared with intravenous hydrocortisone alone\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Clinically important question with relevant patient outcomes measured\n*   A priori publication of trial protocol and statistical analysis plan\n*   Reason for a change in sample size based on power analysis is clearly explained in the manuscript\n*   Conducted at 10 sites including high and middle-income countries\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Open label and lacked blinded outcome assessment, thus creating the possibility of performance and ascertainment bias\n*   Effects of vitamin C and thiamine were not assessed separately\n*   Thiamine levels were not measured in the trial, making it uncertain whether randomised patients did or did not have thiamine hypovitaminosis at randomisation and whether this was corrected\n*   Target MAP set for each patient by treating clinicians was not collected\n*   Trial was underpowered to detect differences in mortality or other patient-centered outcomes\n*   Adverse events were reported only when treating clinicians adjudicated, and patients were not systematically examined for other possible adverse effects (eg, oxaluria) that might develop with high-dose IV vitamin C\n*   There is no data relating to fluid balance or cardiac output monitoring which may have influenced vasopressor requirement\n*   Time to the administration of antibiotics was not collected\n*   The median time from ICU admission to randomisation was 12 hours. Even if delays presenting to Emergency Department and transferring to ICU are not taken into account, this delay may have reduced drug efficacy\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   I will continue my current practice which is not to use the HAT (hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid and thiamine) protocol for treating septic shock\n*   Further studies looking at timing of treatment intervention may be helpful although the unintended consequences of diverting funding from other research opportunities in sepsis and other diseases must also be considered. Completion of several existing trials will hopefully provide the information we need\n*   Whilst we continue our search for the elusive magic bullet for sepsis we must not lose focus on interventions that we know are life saving: the right antibiotics given early, together with antimicrobial stewardship, source control, and optimal\u00a0 physiological support\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\] [Effect of Vitamin C, Hydrocortisone, and Thiamine vs Hydrocortisone Alone on Time Alive and Free of Vasopressor Support Among Patients With Septic Shock.

I have so far been unable to find any published data supporting the importance of timing, though the assumption that urgent treatment for a time critical illness has \u201cface validity\u201d (ie seems to make sense). Dr Fowler\u2019s team in the CITRIS-ALI didn\u2019t seem to put importance on the timing of Vit C related to onset of sepsis \u2013 they sometimes had to wait days for the PFratio to drop <300, which was needed for inclusion in the study. Furthermore, the onset of sepsis can be well before hospital presentation.\n    \n    The burden of proof is on proponents of HAT therapy to produce robust scientific evidence supporting the importance of timing.\n    \n    Unfortunately, given the complete lack of a signal of benefit in this phase 2 study, there may not be interest in pursuing it further.\n    \n    Your bottom line is spot on!\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vitamins/?replytocom=3954#respond)\n    \n*   ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c879f9614e86ec62c39936e8b373d44?s=56&d=mm&r=g) [Leah Owen](https://easyvitamins.co.uk/)\n    \n    [18 November 2020 at 11:29 am](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vitamins/#comment-17436)\n    \n    Good Steve  \n    This study was not powered to detected a minimally meaningful ARR in mortality (eg 1%) but had more than enough power to detect the mortality benefit claimed following the Marik 2017 before-and-after study.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vitamins/?replytocom=17436#respond)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/vitamins/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

consequently a false negative conclusion is possible\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial does not demonstrate a mortality benefit from adding vasopressin if mean arterial pressure is\u00a0adequately maintained with standard\u00a0vasopressors, however\u00a0the strength of this evidence is not strong enough to conclude it definitely does not have a benefit\n*   I shall continue using vasopressin in vasopressor-refractory septic shock, which this trial has\u00a0not investigated\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Vasopressin versus Norepinephrine Infusion in Patients with Septic Shock](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa067373)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[VANISH trial TBL summary](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/vanish/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Vasopressin by LITFL](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/vasopressin/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[Duncan Chambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n  \nSummary date:\u00a08 August 2016  \nPeer-review editor: [Adrian Wong](https://twitter.com/avkwong)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Vasopressors](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/vasopressors/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### 2 comments\n\n*   Pingback: [Global Intensive Care | LITFL Review 244](http://www.globalintensivecare.org/index.php/litfl-review-244/)\n    \n*   Pingback: [Choudhury \u2013 The Bottom Line](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/uncategorized/choudhury/)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/vasst/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Intensive Care Medicine 2017; 43:1637\u20131647. doi:10.1007/s00134-017-4880-3\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill adult patients, does early goal-directed nutrition (EGDN) during ICU stay compared to standard care nutrition delivery result in improved physical quality of life at 6 months?\n\n### Background\n\n*   The importance of nutritional support during critical illness in the ICU is well established. However, the various aspects of delivering this nutritional care is unclear because of diverging conclusions from recent trials. This may contribute to the variations seen in clinical practice and in national and international guidelines\n*   As an example,\u00a0[ESPEN](http://espen.info/documents/enicu.pdf)\n     (European) guidelines recommend\u00a0early-initiation of parenteral nutrition (PN) whilst\u00a0[ASPEN](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0148607115621863?etoc=&)\n     (American and Canadian) guidelines recommend later initiation of PN in adults who are receiving insufficient enteral nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU)\n*   Individualised goal-directed nutrition therapy with measured requirements has been proposed as one of several potentially beneficial strategies. EAT-ICU is the first randomised trial to assess the effect of individualised energy and protein supply to ICU patients, based on indirect calorimetry and 24-h urinary urea excretion (nitrogen balance) on physical quality of life\n\n### Design\n\n*   Single centre randomised controlled trial\n*   Blinded outcome assessment\n*   Computer generated randomisation schedule with varying block sizes (prepared by 2 people independent of the trial)\n*   Allocation was concealed by consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes\n*   Randomised 1:1, stratified according to presence or absence of active haematologic malignancy\n*   Patients were randomised as soon as possible, with the intervention commenced at the latest 24 hours after admission to the ICU\n*   200 patients were required to demonstrate a 15% relative reduction in physical component summary (PCS) score at 6 months, with a significance level 0.05 and 80% power\n    *   Estimations were based on [previous data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21722543)\n         from the study site\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Single ICU (Copenhagen University Hospital) in Denmark\n*   June 2013- October 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Acutely admitted, mechanically ventilated adult patients with a central venous catheter (for PN if required), expected to stay longer than 3 days in ICU\n*   Exclusion mostly based on any particular nutrition requirements\n    *   Contraindications to use enteral nutrition or\u00a0parenteral nutrition, e.g. hypersensitivity towards fish-, egg or peanut protein, or any of the active substances in the PN products\n    *   Receiving a special diet\n    *   Burns > 10% total body surface area\n    *   Severe hepatic failure (Child-Pugh class C) or severe hepatic dysfunction: Bilirubin \u2265 50 \u00b5mol/l (3 mg/dl) + alanine aminotransferase \u2265 3 times upper reference value\n    *   Traumatic brain injury\n    *   Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic acidosis\n    *   Known or suspected hyperlipidemia\n    *   BMI \u2264 17 or severe malnutrition\n    *   Pregnancy\n    *   The clinician finds that the patient is too deranged (circulation, respiration, electrolytes etc.) or that death is imminent\n*   Screened: 2265 patients admitted to the ICU. 586 met inclusion and 383 were excluded. 203 (35%) were randomised (102 to EGDN and 101 to standard care)\n    *   1 in each group died before randomisation and 1 in each group withdrew consent for data, therefore, 199 patients were analysed (100 in EGDN and 99 in standard care)\n*   Baseline characteristics: no statistically significant difference between groups (EGDN vs Standard care)\n    *   Most common source of ICU admission was a hospital ward: 45% vs 38%\n    *   Admission type:\n        *   Medical: 52% vs 43%\n        *   Emergency surgery: 43% vs 54%\n    *   Age, years, median (IQR): 63 (51-72) vs 68 (52-75)\n    *   SAPS II score, median (IQR): 8 (6-11) vs 8 (5-10)\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   **Early Goal Directed Nutrition**\n    \n    *   Calculated nutrition requirements and delivery were based on:\n        1.  Energy delivery directed by indirect calorimetry (IC) at randomisation and every other day\n        2.  24-h urinary urea excretion (nitrogen use) was assessed daily and converted to metabolic protein consumption using Bistrian\u2019s equation\n    \n    *   Nutrition provision was titrated to IC and nitrogen balance with the aim to meet 100% of energy and protein needs on the first full trial day and for the duration of ICU stay (to a maximum of 90 days)\n    *   Protein was provided as at least 1.5 g/kg/day at all times during admission, regardless of urea excretion\n    *   Energy from propofol was included in energy calculations\n    *   Enteral nutrition was initiated within 24 h of randomisation and supplemented with PN if necessary to reach goal requirements\n        *   In case of sustained hyperglycaemia (defined as insulin requirement of at least 5 IU/h for > 12 consecutive hours), glucose was reduced and at a plasma urea above 20 mmol/l, protein was reduced by 0.2 g/kg/day\n    *   Supplemental PN was used if energy and protein needs could not be met by EN alone\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Standard Care**\n    *   Energy requirements calculated by 25/kcal/kg/day\n    *   EN commenced within 24 hours of randomisation and gradually increase as tolerated\n    *   If on day 7 energy needs were not met, supplemental PN was provided\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   The same EN and PN solutions\n*   The same blood glucose level (BGL) aims (6-10 mmol/l)\n*   Supplemental trace elements and vitamins based on measurements\n*   The same gastric residual volume (GRV) cut off and protocol for management (based on usual practice in the ICU)\n*   The same mobilisation protocol (based on usual practice in the ICU)\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: physical quality of life 6 months after randomisation as assessed by the physical component summary (PCS) score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form health survey version\u00a0did not differ between the two groups\n    *   Mean PCS score 22.9 vs standard care: 23.0; p = 0.99\n    *   Similar results in the predefined sensitivity analyses of the complete case population, the per-protocol populations, the two predefined subgroups and in the analyses adjusted for the stratification variable (haematological malignancy) and the predefined baseline variables (age and SOFA score)\n*   Secondary outcomes\n    \n    *   Mortality at day 28, day 90 and at 6 months: no statistical difference between groups\n        *   day 28: 20% dead in EGDT vs 21% in control group\n        *   day 90: 30% dead in EGDT vs 32% in control group\n        *   6 months: 37% dead in EGDT vs 34% in control group\n    *   Cumulative energy and protein balances at day 1, 3 and 7 and over the course of the ICU stay was higher in the EGDN group\n        *   day 1: -211 vs -1011 kcal & 0.07 vs -0.7 g/kg protein\n        *   day 3:\u00a0-220 vs -924 kcal & -0.59 vs -0.83 g/kg protein\n        *   day 7:\u00a0-298 vs -702 kcal & -0.65 vs -0.75 g/kg protein\n        *   last study day:\u00a0-249 vs -747 kcal & -0.56 vs -0.65 g/kg protein\n            *   all p<0.0001\n    *   Insulin requirement: the EGDN group received a greater median (IQR) dose of insulin and had a greater proportion of BGL \u2265 15 mmol/L\n        *   Insulin: 86 (2-530) vs 0 (0-39), p=0.008\n        *   BGL \u2265 15 mmol/L: 52% vs 25%, p=0.0001\n    \n    *   Episodes of hyperglycaemia:\u00a0More patients in the EGDN group experienced at least one episode of hyperglycaemia\n    *   No difference in:\n        *   length of stay among survivors in ICU or hospital\n        *   new organ failure\n        *   time to any infection or type of nosocomial infection\n        *   rates of hypoglycaemia\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The EGDN strategy resulted in greater energy and protein delivery in the ICU compared to standard care, but no differences were observed in PSC score at 6 months or any other clinically important outcomes\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   A highly relevant clinical question and hot research topic\n*   The primary outcome was a long term, physically focused outcome\n*   Study design attempts to address and provide titrated nutrition based on metabolic changes that occur during critical illness. This is only attempted in a few previous RCTs\n*   Provides further evidence about the utility of IC in critical illness\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   This is a small, single centre study, and so the results may not be generalisable to all populations\n*   The primary outcome was a long term outcome, but the intervention was early and very short duration. It may not be biologically plausible that the intervention would effect the outcome\n*   Missing data was imputed. It seemed to be well understood and conducted by the authors but there is always a risk of inappropriate imputation\n*   The patients may not have been likely to benefit from intervention as they were not long stay patients (7 days)\n*   Early nutrition intervention when metabolic processes are aimed to mobilise endogenous energy stores may place the patient under further metabolic stress\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   In critically ill adults, EGDN provided early in ICU stay, and for a short duration, resulted in better nutritional outcomes but there was no difference in clinically important outcomes\n*   This study provides a base from which future research can be conducted into questions such as when nutrition should be commenced and how metabolic processes differ during critical illness\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Early goal-directed nutrition versus standard of care in adult intensive care patients: the single-centre, randomised, outcome assessor-blinded EAT-ICU trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28936712)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Editorial (not open access)](http://icmjournal.esicm.org/journals/abstract.html?v=0&j=134&i=-1&a=4881_10.1007_s00134-017-4881-2&doi=)\n    \n*   \\[videocast\\] [Interview with Anders Perner at ESICM LIVES 2017](https://www.esicm.org/eat-icu-results/)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author:\u00a0[Emma Ridley](https://twitter.com/icunutrition?lang=en)\n  \nSummary date: 18th October 2017  \nPeer-review editor: [Steve Mathieu](https://twitter.com/stevemathieu75)\n\u00a0and [Duncan Chambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Nutrition](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/nutrition/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/eat-icu/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Critical Care Medicine. 2018;epublished August 1. doi:10.1097/CCM.0000000000003350\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients on noradrenaline for haemodynamic support, who required hemofiltration for AKI, does the use of a high cutoff hemofilter compared with a standard hemofilter impact the median hours of noradrenaline-free time at day 7?\n\n### Background\n\n*   In patients receiving CRRT, high cutoff dialysis filters have been promoted as having enhanced middle molecule/inflammatory mediator clearance due to their higher permeability.\u00a0It is not known if patients with vasoplegic states have a clinically meaningful benefit from such practice.\n*   Several small trials have examined this question. An unblinded pilot study of 30 patients showed the group on the HCO filter had a significant decline in \u2018adjusted\u2019 noradrenaline dose over time.\n*   Other studies have examined the optimal dialysis dose in patients with septic shock. For example, the IVOIRE trial looked at high-volume exchanges (70ml/kg/hr vs 35ml/kg/hr) and did not improve outcomes.\n*   Removal of cytokines may be a potentially appealing concept in vasoplegic patients. However, with all appealing concepts the complexity is likely incompletely understood and it is vital that such therapies are tested in well conducted randomised trials before being implemented. The last thing we want to do is cause harm to our patients.\n\n### Design\n\n*   1:1 randomisation within 12 hours of a decision to start hemofiltration\n*   Allocation concealment by computer generated program using permuted block sizes and opaque envelopes\n*   Patients, healthcare workers and researchers were blinded to treatment allocation\n    *   The 2 different filters were indistinguishable in appearance\n*   76 patients in total carried an 80% power of detecting a 25% difference in noradrenaline-free time in the first week with an alpha of 0.05.\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Single centre tertiary ICU in Australia\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion:\n    *   Patients on noradrenaline for haemodynamic support\n    *   Patients requiring CRRT for AKI (oliguria <100ml/6hr, unresponsive to fluid bolus, K+ >6.5mmol/l, acidemic \u00a0pH<7.2, urea > 25mmol/L, Cr>300umol/L or significant organ oedema).\n*   Exclusion:\n    *   <18-years-old\n    *   death imminent\n    *   previous dialysis on this admission or chronic dialysis\n    *   pregnant/breast-feeding\n*   76 patients were randomised (38 per group)\n    *   2 patients were subsequently excluded from analysis (one had an exclusion criteria and one died before treatment started)\n    *   This left 74 patients in the modified intention to treat analysis\n*   Patients were well matched for age, sex, severity of illness (APACHE II, APACHE III and SOFA scores)\n    *   There were some imbalance in the variables lactate, INR and oliguria\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Continuous Veno-venous Haemofiltration with high cutoff filter (CVVH-HCO)\n    *   cut-off point of 100kDa\n\n### Control\n\n*   Continuous Veno-venous Haemofiltration with standard filter (CVVH-std)\n    *   cut-off point 30kDa\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Dialysis dose = 25ml/kg/h\n*   Blood flow 200ml/min\n*   Bicarbonate buffered replacement fluids\n*   Anticoagulation at discretion of treating intensivist, but usually low dose pre-filter heparin\n*   Maximum duration of therapy = 14 days\n*   Dialysis continued until not needed, ICU discharge or death\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: median cumulative hours of **noradrenaline-free** time within the first week after randomisation\n    *   If the patient died whilst on noradrenaline, the days after death contributed to zero noradrenaline-free hours\n    *   CVVH-HCO: 32 hours\u00a0noradrenaline-free\n    *   CVVH-std: 56 hours noradrenaline-free\n    *   P = 0.052\n*   **Secondary outcome**: CVVH-HCO vs CVVH-std\n    *   Maximum noradrenaline rates: similar\n    *   Albumin levels: no difference\n    *   Time to cease dialysis: no difference\n    *   Unadjusted ICU mortality OR 2.17 (95% CI 0.84-5.58 p=0.109)\n    *   Unadjusted hospital mortality OR 2.4 (95% CI 0.94-6.15 p=0.067)\n    *   Adjusted for lactate, INR, serum albumin and APACHE 3\n        *   Adjusted ICU mortality OR 2.13 (95% CI 0.69-6.65 p=0.191)\n        *   Adjusted hospital mortality OR 2.49 (95% CI 0.81-7.66 p=0.112)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   In patients with severe acute kidney injury and vasoplegic shock, use of a high cutoff dialysis filter compared with a standard filter, did not result in more noradrenaline-free time and did not improve other important secondary outcomes\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Allocation concealment and permuted block sizes (minimising selection bias)\n*   Modified intention to treat analysis, complete follow-up (minimising attrition bias)\n*   Double-blinded (reducing detection bias)\n*   Baseline imbalances were minor and were adjusted for in the secondary outcomes (reducing selection bias)\n*   Other than the intervention applied, patients were managed in a pragmatic way at the clinicians discretion (minimising performance bias)\n*   The primary outcome of \u201cnoradrenaline-free time within the first week after randomisation\u201d is a robust surrogate and ameliorates the competing risk of mortality impacting on noradrenaline dose\n*   The sample may be suitable for extrapolation to vasoplegic patients in general (with AKI and shock) as the sample was somewhat heterogenous (mainly septic shock, cardiogenic shock and liver failure)\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   The primary outcome is a surrogate outcome and may not be clinically meaningful\n*   Some of the secondary outcomes are clinically meaningful but it is difficult to draw too many conclusions from these as the study is not powered to detect a difference in these events, eg mortality\n*   There were some baseline imbalances reflecting the small sample size\n    *   These were adjusted for but the analysis may not completely ameliorate this bias\n*   There was no economic assessment\n    *   I know in the unit I work the price difference between HCO filters and standard filters is $275 vs $240, which is not a great difference in the scheme of things\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial is very informative. There does not seem to be a benefit in using high cutoff filters. There is a signal toward harm.\n*   Outside the setting of a larger clinical trial, I will not use high cutoff filters in my vasoplegic patients with AKI.\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[A Double-Blind RCT of High Cutoff vs Standard Hemofiltration in Critically Ill Patients with AKI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30074491)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[IVOIRE trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740278)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Pilot study on the effects of high cutoff hemofiltration on the need for norepinephrine in septic patients with acute renal failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16763508)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Celia Bradford](http://twitter.com/CeliaBradford)\n  \nSummary date: 23 August 2018  \nPeer-review editor: [Duncan Chambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Dialysis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/dialysis/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n[Renal](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/renal/)\n[Sepsis](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/sepsis/)\n[Shock](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/shock/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/atan/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Chest 2017; 152(4):712-722. doi:\u00a010.1016/j.chest.2017.03.061\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients undergoing emergency intubation, does the ramped position compared to sniffing position reduce the incidence of oxygen desaturation?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Hypoxaemia occurs in nearly 50% of Critical Care intubations\n*   Patient position may improve variables such as functional residual capacity and laryngeal anatomy\n*   Observational data support the ramped position (torso and head elevated) compared to the sniffing position (patient supine, neck flexed and head extended)\n\n### Design\n\n*   2 x 2 factorial design\n    *   Other side of the study assessed the use of an intubation checklist vs standard care in the critically ill adults: [CHECK-UP Checklist](/summaries/icm/check-up-checklist)\n        \n*   Randomised, multicentre pragmatic trial\n*   Patients randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer and permuted blocks\n*   Data collected by an independent observer, with quality/accuracy assurance carried out on 10% of the cases\n*   248 patients required to power the study at 80% to detect a difference between the two groups in primary outcome of 5%\n    *   5% chosen based on previous similar studies\n    *   Initial power calculations required only 170 patients\n    *   After assessment of the standard deviations (SD) of the primary outcome for the whole study population at 6 months, the SD was larger than anticipated so a new power calculation was performed\n        *   Group assignments remained concealed\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n\n### Setting\n\n*   Four tertiary ICUs in the United States\n*   July 2015 to July 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion:\u00a0Patients over the age of 18 undergoing endotracheal intubation by critical care or pulmonary fellows in the medical ICU\n*   Exclusion:\n    *   If intubation was so urgent that the clinician felt the randomisation envelope could not be obtained in time\n    *   If treating clinicians felt that a specific position was clinically indicated\n*   309 eleigible, 49 excluded (42 due to urgency, 6 due to specifically indicated intubation position), 260 randomised\n*   The most common reasons for intubation in both groups were sepsis, altered mental status and pneumonia\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   Ramped position for intubation\n    *   Electronic bed used to elevate head of the bed to 25 degrees with the lower half of the bed parallel to the floor\n    *   Patient\u2019s head was positioned at the top of the mattress so it hung slightly off the bed with the face parallel to the ceiling\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8A4EC5EF-CCB0-4E58-946B-27AB091FF81C.png)\n\nThe Ramped Position for Intubation\n\n### Control\n\n*   Sniffing position for intubation\n    *   Entire bed remained horizontal\n    *   Folded blankets/towels placed beneath the patient\u2019s head with the neck in flexion and the head in extension as if \u201csniffing the air\u201d.\n\n![](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8D506BC2-B515-4F61-8A52-7A22DD816792.png)\n\nThe \u201cSniffing the Air\u201d Position for Intubation\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   All aspects of the intubation procedure were at the discretion of the clinical team\n*   Measures of primary outcomes took place from the moment the procedural medications were administered until two minutes after the successful intubation\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome:**\u00a0There was no statistically significant difference in the median lowest oxygen saturation between the sniffing and the ramped positions\n    *   Sniffing \u2013 92% \\[IQR 79-98%\\]\n    *   Ramped \u2013 93% \\[IQR 84-99%\\]\n    *   This still held true after multivariable linear regression analysis to adjust for cofounders including saturation at induction, BMI, operator experience and use of video laryngoscopy\n*   **Secondary outcome:**\n    *   The view achieved and difficulty of the intubation was worse in the ramped group\n        *   Cormack-Lehane view Grade III or IV:\n            *   Sniffing 11.6% vs Ramped 25.4% (p=0.01)\n        *   Operator reported \u201cdifficult\u201d intubation:\n            *   Sniffing 4.6% vs Ramped 12.3% (p=0.04)\n    *   Therefore, the rate of failed intubation attempts was unsurprisingly higher in the ramped group\n        *   First attempt success:\n            *   Sniffing 85.4% vs Ramped 76.2% (p=0.02)\n        *   More than 3 attempts at laryngoscopy:\n            *   Sniffing 2.3% vs Ramped 7.7% (p=0.02)\n    *   No difference between other oxygenation or haemodynamic secondary outcomes\n        *   Oxygenation outcomes\n            *   Incidence of hypoxia or severe hypoxia, desaturation and absolute change from baseline saturation\n        *   Haemodynamic outcomes\n            *   Lowest systolic BP, systolic BP <65, use of a vasopressor and cardiac arrest within 10mins of intubation\n*   **Tertiary data, subgroup or post-hoc analyses**\n    *   No statistically significant difference in tertiary outcomes of ventilator free days, ICU days or in-hospital mortality\n    *   In post-hoc analysis, the operator\u2019s previous intubating experience did not alter the primary outcome\n    *   Similarly, the operator\u2019s prior experience in the ramped position did not alter the primary outcome\n        *   Although this data was only available for 73.8% of the intubations carried out\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   The ramped position was not associated with an increase in the lowest arterial saturation during intubation of critically ill patients in the ICU, but it may increase the difficulty of the intubation and the likelihood of repeated attempts\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Relevant question for daily ICU practice, especially as data from the anaesthetic room does not always translate well to the ICU\n*   Prospective, multicentre study with larger numbers than similar trials in the anaesthetic room\n*   First study of its kind in the ICU\n*   Baseline characteristics well balanced between the two groups, importantly including pre-oxygenation method, APACHE II score, BMI and difficult airway characteristics\n*   Minimal deviation from protocol (3 total)\n*   Quality assurance took place to improve accuracy of data collection.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Factorialised design\n    *   Although they claim that there was no interaction between the position and the use of a checklist (p=0.94), they both assessed the same primary outcome\n    *   Would have been better to do these two studies separately\n*   Incomplete data for the clinician\u2019s past experience with the ramped position as it was only available for 73.8% of cases\n*   Only included fellow/trainee clinicians\n    *   Would have been better to also include those performed by the more senior clinicians\n    *   Cases where the senior clinician feels that they must have first attempt at intubation are perhaps sicker or more challenging\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   Among adult ICU patients, the ramped position did not improve the lowest recorded saturations but did increase the difficulty of intubation and the likelihood of repeated attempts\n*   Despite the ramped position being more technically challenging, this did not translate into any difference in any patient-centred outcomes\n*   We should therefore still assess each intubation on a case by case basis, factoring in our previous experience and comfort level when choosing patient position for intubating the critically unwell patient\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[A multicenter, randomized trial of ramped position vs sniffing position during

Whilst the clinicians followed guidelines for the letter, they were otherwise free to write what they wanted to\n*   The psychological status of the relatives at the time they received the condolence letter was not evaluated\n*   The outcome measure were assessed at one and six months. This may have been too short to demonstrate any longer term benefit\n*   14% relatives (34 patients) did not complete the HADS at one month\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This is an important study evaluating a simple intervention to try and improve grief symptoms amongst family members. It unexpectedly showed that condolence letters may increase depression and PTSD symptoms amongst family members at 6 months\n*   Grief is a complex process with many confounders, including individual adaptive response and external influences. These nuances and impact are difficult to evaluate\n*   Our current departmental policy of sending out condolence cards will continue. However, we will review the timing, content and potential deleterious effects\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Effect of a condolence letter on grief symptoms among relatives of patients who died in the ICU: a randomized clinical trial](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-016-4669-9)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[A communication strategy and brochure for relatives of patients dying in the ICU.

These rates are higher in patients that are critically ill\n*   Studies have suggested that the risk of iatrogenic events is increased by practitioner stressors. One such stressor may be rudeness\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised controlled trial\n    *   Stratified by unit and hospital\n    *   Randomisation performed by research assistant\n    *   \u2018Randomly assigned to teams at the same time and shift of the day based on availability in the NICU\u2019\n    *   Randomly assigned to the control or incivility group\n*   Experimenter and the participants were blinded to the group allocation\n*   Participants performed a 1-hour simulation in their own NICU followed by a workshop on team reflexivity\n    *   Simulation observed on webcam by \u2018international world expert\u2019\n    *   Managed pre-term infant with necrotizing enterocolitis who was in respiratory failure and shock, who then went on to develop a cardiac tamponade secondary to a central line\n*   Assessor of performance blinded to group assignment (2 senior physicians and 1 senior nurse read written documentation and watched recorded simulation)\n    *   Performance rated on 5 point scale (1 = failed, 2 = poor, 3 = moderate, 4 = good, 5 = excellent) with descriptions and examples of indicative behaviour for each score.

June 21 2018. NEJM 2018;378:2365-75. DOI:10:1056/NEJMoa1802637\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   For surrogate decision makers of critically ill patients, does a multi-component family support intervention impact on the surrogates\u2019 hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) at 6 months?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Intensive care admissions are a psychologically taxing time for patients and their families. Residual grief and stress can persist well after the ICU admission particularly if the surrogate\u2019s loved one has died, has not returned to baseline function or is needing extra support from their family or community.\n*   Communication between Intensive Care staff and families is often ad hoc, time-pressured and delivered by miscellaneous health care professionals.\n*   A study published in JAMA in 2016 reported a randomised trial of meetings with families with standard communication (ICU physicians) compared with extra palliative care-led meetings (meeting at Day 7 + Day 17) did not show any benefit to the HADS at 3 months and worsened symptoms of PTSD.\n*   A trial randomising families who had lost a loved one in ICU to receive a letter of condolence or standard care failed to reduce PTSD or improve satisfaction. Read the TBL summary of this [Kentish-Barnes](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/condolence/)\n    \u00a0trial.\n*   Multi-disciplinary support of families in crisis is a logical and inexpensive approach to communication but data is lacking as to how effective it is.\n\n### Design\n\n*   PARTNER = Pairing Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-Driven Emotional Support and Relationship-Building\n*   Multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised trial\n*   5 different ICUs represented the unit of randomised\n    *   Each started in the control phase which lasted a randomly assigned time\n    *   Each unit then transitioned to the intervention phase\n*   Telephone interviews to the surrogates were conducted 6 months after the patient\u2019s hospital discharge by research staff who were unaware of the allocation\n*   The surrogates provided written informed consent for their participation\n*   The intervention was classified \u201cQuality Improvement\u201d whilst the surrogate follow-up was classified \u201cResearch\u201d\n\n### Setting\n\n*   5 ICUs in 5 hospitals in the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre Health System\n    *   2 medical-surgical ICU, 1 medical ICU, 1 specialising in neurologic illness, 1 specialising in transplant surgery\n*   Patient enrolment occurred between July 2012 and August 2015 with follow-up of surrogates ending in February 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   **Inclusion**: Patients >18 years without decision-making capacity, with at least 1 of:\n    *   Ventilated (> 4 days),\n    *   An estimated chance of death of at least 40%, or\n    *   Estimated chance of long-term impairment of at least 40%\n*   **Exclusion**: no surrogate decision maker or patient receiving palliative treatment\n*   1420 patients: 547 in intervention arm, 873 in control arm\n*   There were some baseline imbalances; those in the intervention group were older, had higher severity of acute illness scores and greater number of chronic comorbidities\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   The intervention had 3 main components:\n    1.  The interprofessional team was overseen by 4-6 nurses (PARTNER nurses) who received advanced communication training focusing on supporting the families of the critically ill\n    2.  A PARTNER nurse would meet with the family/surrogate on a daily basis and arranged a clinician-family meeting within 48 hours of admission and every 5-7 days thereafter\n    3.  A quality-improvement specialist was utilised to incorporate the family-support pathway into the clinician\u2019s workflow\n\n### Control\n\n*   Usual care (none of the ICUs had a protocolized approach to family communication)\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   All other aspects of care were determined by the treating clinicians\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**: The surrogates\u2019 symptoms of anxiety and depression as assessed by a HADS scale at 6 months, with scores ranging 0\u201342 with a higher score indicating worse symptoms\n    *   Unadjusted and adjusted (detailed below) analysis: no difference\n        *   Intervention: 11.7 +/- 7.9\n        *   Control: 12.1 +/-8.5\n        *   Estimated effect of intervention: -0.34 (95% CI -1.67 to 0.99; P = 0.61)\n*   Secondary outcome:\n    *   The IES score assessing PTSD; no significant difference intervention vs control \u00a0(P = 0.49)\n    *   QOC score assessing clinician-family communication was significantly better in the intervention group (P = 0.001)\n    *   PPPC score measuring the patient and family-centredness of care was significantly better in the intervention group (P = 0.006)\n    *   The ICU length of stay was shorter in the intervention group (P = 0.045), mediated by increased early mortality in the intervention group\n*   Patients\u2019 Clinical Outcomes: Intervention vs Control\n    *   In-hospital death: 38% vs 30.2% (P = 0.008)\n    *   Death at 6 months: 62% vs 54.1% (P = 0.17)\n    *   Living independently at home at 6 months: 1% vs 2.6% (P = 0.9)\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Among critically ill patients and their surrogates, a family-support intervention delivered by the existing interprofessional ICU team did not affect the surrogates\u2019 symptoms of depression and anxiety at 6 months, but the surrogates\u2019 ratings of the quality of communication and the patient- and family-centered-ness of care were better and the length of stay in ICU shorter with the intervention than with usual care.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   The trial design (step-wedged, cluster-randomised design) is a clever way to assess the impact of a quality intervention where whole ICU care processes are changed\n*   HADS is a well validated measure of anxiety and depression\n*   The effect of the intervention was examined from the perspective of patients, health care providers, surrogates and use of health care resources.\n*   Appropriate statistical adjustment given known baseline differences between intervention and control group\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Out of 1420 patients included only 57% completed the 6 month follow-up\n    *   The drop-out rates were similar between the intervention and the control group\n    *   The supplementary appendix suggests that there were a higher proportion of blacks who were lost to follow-up than not (9.9% vs 5.9%; P = 0.01)\n    *   This high loss to follow-up severely compromises this study\u2019s validity\n*   There was significant baseline imbalance\n    *   This was corrected for in the adjusted analysis but may contribute to confounding bias\n*   Analysis was by intention to treat, but this was only applied to those who agreed to be interviewed at 6 months, not all who were randomised\n*   The study was conducted within the confines of the UPMC health system potentially limiting its external validity\n*   There was no quantitative analysis of how the intervention changed the interactions with families, although there were regular site visits with the PARTNER nurses observed in their interactions with families\n*   The reduced length of ICU stay (due to increased mortality in the intervention arm) is unlikely due to the communication bundle, but more likely due to the mismatch in the severity of the acute illness between the groups, as the difference is almost entirely due to more deaths in the intervention arm rather than live discharge\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   An interprofessional support package for families/surrogates of critically ill patients is a logical and cost-effective way to improve quality of communication and \u00a0patient and family centred support\n*   The baseline imbalances and high loss to follow-up in this trial limit drawing conclusions from this intervention\n*   Further trials with greater internal and external validity would add to this important area of ICU research\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[A Randomised Trial of a Family-Support Intervention in Intensive Care Units](http://ceel.sums.ac.ir/vjc/images/scholar/familysupportinterventioninICU.pdf)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Effect of Palliative Care-Led Meetings for Families fo Patients with Chronic Critical Illness: A Ranodmized Clinical Trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380343)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\]\u00a0[Effect of a Condolence letter on grief symptoms among relatives of patients who died in ICU: a randomised clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28197680)\n    \n\n#### Metadata\n\nSummary author: [Celia Bradford](http://twitter.com/celiabradford)\n  \nSummary date: 8 August 2018  \nPeer-review editor: [Duncan Chambler](http://twitter.com/DuncanChambler)\n\n[Communication](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/communication/)\n[Featured](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/clinical-topics/featured/)\n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bling-490x280.jpeg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/bling-iii/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Copy-of-OXYGEN-ICU-twitter-9-490x280.png)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/preoxi-trial-noninvasive-ventilation-for-preoxygenation/)\n \n\n[![](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Enrich-490x280.jpg)](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/enrich/)\n \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/partner/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. NEJM 2015; 372:1410-1418. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1500704\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients requiring blood, does transfusion with \u201cfresh\u201d RBC\u2019s (stored for 8 days or less) compared with standard issue RBCs (stored 2-42 days) reduce 90 day mortality?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Multicenter, randomised controlled trial\n*   Randomisation occurred by a centralised computer with stratification according to study site\n*   Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study groups with the use of permuted blocks of varying sizes of 6, 8 or 10\n*   Intention to treat analysis\n*   Interim analyses occurred after each consecutive group of 500 patients had been followed for 90 days\n*   Estimated that 2266 patients was required for the study to be 90% powered to detect an absolute difference in mortality of 5% from a baseline mortality of 25%\n\n### Setting\n\n*   64 tertiary care intensive care units in Canada and Europe\n    *   26 Canada, 20 UK, 10 France, 7 Netherlands, 1 Belgium\n*   March 2009 \u2013 May 2014\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion:\n    *   Patients administered RBC transfusion up to seven days post ICU-admission\n    *   Anticipated length of mechanical ventilation of at least 48 hours\n\n*   Exclusion: < 18 years; RBC transfusion prior to ICU admission; terminal illness with life expectancy < 3 months; undergone elective cardiac surgical care during the same hospitalisation; futility; refusal to receive transfusion; intensivist refused participation in study; no available RBCs in the blood bank with a storage time of 7 days or less; requirement of more than one unit of uncross-matched blood; patients requiring specifically matched blood due to autoantibodies\n\n*   2510 patients randomised of whom outcome data available for 2430\n    *   baseline characteristics were similar in both groups\n    *   mean APACHE 21.8\n    *   mean length of ICU stay 2.4 days\n    *   mostly medical (71%) and emergency patients (96.7%)\n    *   most required invasive ventilation (97.4%) and vasoactive support (62.8%)\n    *   mean pretransfusion Hb was 7.7g/dl\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   \u2018Fresh\u2019 blood transfusion \u2013 stored for 8 days or less\n    *   1211 patients\n    *   protocol specified that if red cells < 8 days old were not available then the freshest compatible red cells were issued. The average duration of storage was 6.1 +/- 4.9 days\n        *   84% received only RBCs stored for <8 days\n\n### Control\n\n*   Standard blood transfusion \u2013 stored 2 \u2013 42 days\n    *   1219 patients\n    *   the oldest compatible red cells were issued. The average duration of storage was 22.0 +/- 8.4 days\n\nFor both intervention and control groups:\n\n*   All blood was leukoreduced before storage and suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM)\n*   Local guidelines and practice for bedside transfusion were adopted\n*   All decisions regarding patient care was at the discretion of the attending physicians and the clinical team\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: 90 day mortality\n    *   448 patients (37%) vs. 430 patients (35%) (Absolute Risk Difference 1.7%; 95% CI -2.1-5.5)\n*   Secondary outcomes: No statistical difference between the groups in any of the outcomes\n    *   time to death in ICU, in hospital and by day 28\n    *   major illness including MODS, ARDS, heart failure, cardiac ischaemia or MI, DVT or PE\n    *   duration of respiratory support\n    *   duration of haemodynamic suppport\n    *   duration of renal support\n    *   length of stay in the hospital\n    *   transfusion reactions\n*   Subgroup analysis: No difference\n    *   90d mortality in the patients who received a transfusion (excluded 94 patients who did not actually receive blood\n    *   90d mortality in the patients who only received blood that had been stored for < 8 days vs those that had received blood stored for more than 7 days\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   Transfusion of fresh red cells, as compared with standard-issue red cells, did not decrease the 90-day mortality among critically ill patients\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Concealment of the age of the red cells by an opaque sticker affixed over the expiration and collection dates\n*   Blood transfusion technologists refrained from releasing information on storage duration to all clinical and research personnel\n*   Protocol, including details of trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan was published a priori\n*   Only 3.9% of patients lost to follow up. This was less than the number anticipated when the study was planned\n*   The rate of adherence to the transfusion protocol was 95.4%\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   94 patients (3.9%) did not receive any blood transfusion. This has been considered in the sub-group analysis\n*   Lack of uniform guideline or protocol across centres for transfusion. However, a pragmatic study and this is acknowledged in the manuscript\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This study shows that fresh blood which has been stored for < 8 days is no better than blood stored up to 42 days. Transfusion triggers and processes for safe administration of blood are probably more important\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article abstract\\]\u00a0[Age of Transfused Blood in Critically Ill Adults](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1500704)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Transfusion Literature Summaries](http://lifeinthefastlane.com/ccc/transfusion-literature-summaries/)\n    \n*   \\[further reading\\] [Effects of Red-Cell Storage Duration on Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414219)\n    \n*   further reading\\] [Is fresher blood better?

The proportion using capnography seems dangerously low for what should be mandated monitoring for all intubations within ICU\n*   Some adverse events (difficulty, injuries) were operator reported \u2013 this could result in underreporting\n*   Management of everything else pre, during and after intubation was at discretion of treating teams.

ICM 2018; published first online 3rd July 2018. Doi:10.1007/s00134-018-5267-9\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In critically ill patients with septic shock, does the use of terlipressin compared to norepinephrine reduced 28-day mortality?\n\n### Background\n\n*   Sepsis is one of the most common conditions treated by critical care clinicians worldwide\n*   The best management strategies e.g. target parameters, fluids, vasopressors, etc remain widely debated\n*   Traditional vasopressors such as norepinephrine and adrenaline are now being joined by newer agents, such as vasopressin, terlipressin and angiotensin 2, with mixed results\n*   Terlipressin, being more selective for V1 receptors, has theoretical benefits over non-selective vasopressin\n*   Previous [trial](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/choudhury/)\n    \u00a0in patients with liver cirrhosis showed that terlipressin is as effective as norepinephrine as a vasopressor in patients with cirrhosis and septic shock\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, multicentre\n*   Double-blinded (patient, clinicians and assessors)\n*   Stratified by investigating centres combined with block randomisation\n*   Randomisation by sequential numbered, opaque, computer-generated sealed envelopes\n*   Modified intention-to-treat analysis\n*   Power calculation\n    *   Baseline mortality 50% at 28 days\n    *   Powered at 80% to detect absolute 10% difference\n    *   10% estimated drop-out rate\n    *   Two-sided alpha error of 0.05\n    *   Target recruitment 1100 pts\n\n### Setting\n\n*   21 ICUs in China\n*   January 2013 to February 2016\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: Over 18 years old with septic shock\n    *   2 SIRS criteria\n    *   Proven or suspected infection\n    *   Hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation\n        *   Hypotension defined as SBP<90mmHg, MAP<70mmHg or SBP decrease >40mmHg or > 2 standard deviation below normal for age\n*   Exclusion: unstable coronary syndrome, previous use of terlipressin for BP support during current ICU admission, malignancy or disease for which mortality was estimated to be very high, acute mesenteric ischaemia (suspected or proven), Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, pregnancy, organ transplantation\n*   684 pts screened -> 617 randomised -> 526 analysed (260 terlipressin, 266 noradrenaline\n    *   14% lost to follow up, withdrew or excluded post-randomisation\n*   Baseline characteristics similar in both groups\n    *   Mean age 61\n    *   Mean SOFA 11\n    *   Mean APACHE2 score 19\n    *   Mean BP 67mmHg\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   **Terlipressin**\n    *   Made as 0.02 mg/ml in 50mls syringes\n    *   Commenced at 1 ml/hr (0.33 mcg/min)\n    *   Titrated 1\u20138 ml/hr (max 2.66 mcg/min)\n\n### Control\n\n*   **Norepinephrine**\n    *   Made as 0.22 mg/ml in 50mls syringes\n    *   Commenced at 1 ml/hr (3.66 mcg/min)\n    *   Titrated 1\u20138 ml/hr (max 29.33 mcg/min)\n\n#### Management common to both groups\n\n*   Titrated to achieve target BP (suggested MAP of 65 to 75 mmHg but left to discretion of treating ICU physician)\n*   Open label norepinephrine was allowed if target BP not achieved with maximum rate of study drug\n*   Other open label vasopressors if maximum dose of study drug AND open label norepinephrine failed to achieve target BP\n*   Tapering of open label drug was conducted first before study drug tapered\n*   Tapering of study drug only when target BP maintained for 12 hrs without open label drugs\n*   Study drug was interrupted if any serious adverse events occurred (defined)\n*   If subsequent recurrence of shock required\u00a0vasopressors, the study drug was preferentially used\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   **Primary outcome**:\n    *   No significant difference in 28 day all cause mortality\n    *   Terlipressin group: 40%\n    *   Norepinephrine group: 38%\n    *   Absolute risk increase (ARI): 2% (95% CI -9.8% to 18.8%;\u00a0P = 0.633)\n*   **Secondary outcome**:\n    *   No significant difference in:\n        *   Changes in SOFA score on day 7 after randomisation\n        *   Days alive\n        *   Days free of vasopressor during 28 days after randomisation\n    *   More serious adverse events in terlipressin group\n        *   Terlipressin group 30% vs noradrenaline group 11.65%\n        *   Mainly digital ischaemia\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   There was no significant reduction in 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock treated with terlipressin compared to norepinephrine\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Good external generalisability \u2013 multicentre trial with inclusion and exclusion criteria comparable to other trials\n*   Study protocol published on\u00a0[clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01697410)\n    \n*   Consideration of possible heterogeneity in patients and inter-hospital care in randomisation process, by using blocks of random allocation\n*   Very thorough concealment of sequence, randomisation, and blinding of those involved, which reduces systematic biases and strengthens the internal validity\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Trial was terminated (50% recruitment) due to futility \u2013 the trial was under-powered as the observed mortality rate was considerably less than the expected mortality rate\n*   Significant number of patients lost post-randomisation which could introduce bias\n*   Significant proportion of the terlipressin group required addition of norepinephrine and dopamine (86%) with the mean norepinephrine dose of 0.48 mcg/kg/min\n*   Baseline mean BP at randomisation was 67mmHg which suggests that the patients in this study may not have required vasopressor therapy\n    *   Data in the supplementary material showed that both groups had fluid intake of positive four litres per day in the first 2 days after randomisation\n*   Short term outcomes (28 day and hospital mortality) were assessed and therefore any long-term differences between treatment groups cannot be assessed\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial does not show a mortality benefit from using terlipressin compared to norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor\n*   Use of terlipressin as first line led to significantly more serious adverse events, especially digital ischaemia\n*   I shall continue my current practice of using norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor, and add vasopressin in those patients with vasopressor-refractory septic shock\n\n#### External Links\n\n*   \\[article\\]\u00a0[Terlipressin versus norepinephrine as infusion in patients with septic shock: a multicentre, randomised,

What they mean is that they were never going to find p<0.05 given the results so far. We have already criticised the excessive use of P values in our blog.\n    \n    They state the absolute risk increase is 2% (95% CI -9.8 to 18.8%). I calculate slightly different 95% CI of -6.3% to 10.4%.  \n    What they conclude is that the true absolute difference is somewhere between 9.8% in favour of terlipressin to 18.8% in favour of noradrenaline. That's a massive range and both extremes are clinically important.\n    \n    Using my calculated 95% CI values, it could be that terlipressin is beneficial with a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of up to 16, or it could be harmful with a number-needed-to-harm (NNH) of up to 10. Those are potentially game changing in my opinion.\n    \n    I use terlipressin (second line to norad though) and I want to know if that terli is good, bad or indifferent for my patients, and this trial proves neither. This conclusion is worse than futile; it is ethically wasteful in my opinion.\n    \n    I understand resources must be justified, but I am disappointed that this trial was terminated early despite the wide and clinically important 95% Confidence Intervals.\n    \n    [Reply](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/liu/?replytocom=898#respond)\n    \n\n### Leave a Reply [Cancel reply](/summaries/icm/liu/#respond)\n\nYour email address will not be published.

NEMJ 2013;369:2197-206\n\n### Clinical Question\n\n*   In adults that suffer an out-of-hospitals (OOH) cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause, does induced therapeutic hypothermia targeting 36\u00b0C compared to 33\u00b0C reduce mortality or reduce neurological deficit?\n\n### Design\n\n*   Randomised, controlled clinical trial\n*   Single blinded\n\n### Setting\n\n*   36 intensive care units\n*   Europe and Australia\n*   November 2010 and January 2013\n\n### Population\n\n*   Inclusion: adult patients who were unconscious (GCS < 8) on admission to hospital after OOH cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause.\n*   Exclusion: > 6 hours from ROSC to enrolment screening, unwitnessed arrest with systole, hypothermia < 30\u00b0C, suspected or known intracranial haemorrhage.\n*   950 patients enrolled\n\n### Intervention\n\n*   28 hours of temperature management with a target of 36\u00b0C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation.\n    *   4 patients did not receive this intervention as assigned\n\n### Control\n\n*   28 hours of temperature management with a target of 33\u00b0C using invasive or surface cooling, followed by gradual warming to 37\u00b0C at 0.5\u00b0C per hour and avoidance of pyrexia for 72 hours from randomisation\n    *   3 patients did not receive this control as assigned\n\n### Outcome\n\n*   Primary outcome: There was no difference in all-cause mortality through to the end of the trial (mean follow-up period was 256 days).\n    *   48% had died in the 36\u00b0C group and 50% had died in the 33\u00b0C group.\n    *   The hazard ratio for death was 1.06 for cooling to 33\u00b0C (CI 0.89 to 1.28; p=0.51)\n*   Secondary outcome: There were no differences between the groups regarding their neurological status (modified Rankin scale or Cerebral Performance Category).\n\n### Authors\u2019 Conclusions\n\n*   This trial does not provide evidence that targeting a body temperature of 33\u00b0C confers any benefit for unconscious patients admitted to the hospital after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as compared with targeting a body temperature of 36\u00b0C.\n\n### Strengths\n\n*   Highly relevant clinical question\n*   Well designed, pragmatic methodology\n*   Objective outcomes assessed by blinded external physicians\n*   Intention-to-treat analysis with minimal drop-out / loss-to-follow-up\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n*   Not generalisable to arrests with long or unknown \u2018down-time\u2019\n    *   Unwitnessed arrests with systole as initial rhythm were excluded\n    *   90% had bystander witness; 73% had bystander CPR\n    *   Median time to basic life support was 1 minute!\n    *   Median time to advanced life support was 9 and 10 minutes\n    *   Median time to ROSC was 25 minutes\n*   Follow-up was relatively short-term; unclear if 36\u00b0C confers long-term neurological benefit or harm.\n*   Wide confidence intervals: with 95% certainty, true hazard ratio for 33\u00b0C could be anywhere between 0.89 (strong benefit) and 1.28 (strong harm).\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n*   This trial has not shown any benefit of therapeutic hypothermia at 33\u00b0C over 36\u00b0C after OOH cardiac arrest. Not everyone agrees this is the same as \u201c36\u00b0C is equivalent to 33\u00b0C\u201d.\n*   My conclusion: if cooling a patient to the conventional 33\u00b0C induces unwanted effects, aim for 36\u00b0C instead and it _probably_ will make no difference to the patient\u2019s outcome.\n\n#### Links\n\nFull text pdf not available without subscription / [abstract](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1310519)\n\u00a0/ doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1310519\n\n#### Editorial or Commentaries\n\nSo many to choose!\n\n*   Simon Carley at St Emlyn\u2019s Blog: [JC: What\u2019s the target temperature for OOHCA cooling.
